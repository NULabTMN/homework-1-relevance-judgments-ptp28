aged Partial Liht of Dead and
Disabled Accident Occurred ut
Treuiunt and lloylbtoti Streets.
Boston, March 4. An explosion lias just
occurred in the subway excavation at the
corner of Trcraont and Ooylston streets.
Three electric cars that were passing
at the time were wrecked and one ot
them was burned. Several bulldingsin the
vicinity were more or less damaged.
The explosion was caused by escaping
gas.
Among the buildings damaged are the
Hotel Pclliam, the Knickerbocker and
Head buildings and the Masonic Temple.
Window glass in buildings within 200
feet of the scene of the explosion were
shattered.
At least twelve persons were killed.
Four bodies have been removed to un
dertaking' rooms.
Forty-two persons arc at the Emergency
Hospital.
Among the dead are:
Rev. W. A. Slack, professor at Tufts Col
lege. G. I). Bigclow, conductor.
Unknown man and woman.
The injured include James Reardon, John
J. O'Conuor, Thomas F. Ford, Mrs. J. R.
Wilson, Nellie Jackson, Lucy Dolan, F.
W. Tceling, and Mrs. F. A. reck
There seems to be no doubt thatatleast
eight persons were immediately killed.
The explosion came Jutt as the streetcars
were almost in the ceutcr of the space at
the corner.
The first car was In the center when the
explosion came. The whole of the wood
work, which is used as a bridge over the
subway, was lifted into the air, carrying
the first car with it and taking along the
two horses of the second car. The other
Tehlcles were lifted straight into the air,
but came down on the tracks. Instantly
the air was filled with flying debris.
The firat electric car, the one in which
most or the killed were riding, no sooner
reached the track than It broke in hair,
and the whole portion Immediately burst
into flame. Then someone sounded a fire
alarm. This brought a large rescue force
to the scene, and almost immediately calls
were being sent out hurriedly for the am
bulances. It was an awful Eight that met the gaze
of those who were first on the scene. In
the center was the long blazing electric
car. .Close beride this were the bodies ot
the two horses killed instantly, and about
ten, twenty, thirty feet away from where
the woodwork of the car was blazing lay
the dead and wounded people. Those who
wore not injured in the cars on Boylston
6treet were Incapable ot action
at first, and people in the buildings and
stores surrounding did not know what had
occurred, but it did not take them long
to secure their senses, and almost imme
diately there was a rush to the assistance
ot the wounded.
It is stated that there was not a person
on the three cars who was not injured, and
all the wounds received were severe. Im
mediately stores and offices were con
verted into temporary hospitals until am
bulances could arrive. 1 1 was a gruesome
spectacle to see these bodies exposed on
the sidewalks.
Hose carriages were pressed into service
as ambulances, and immediately they were
started on their humane duty or getting the
maimed to the hospitals.
It Is supposed that-one of the dead women
at Jones' undertaking rooms Is Mrs. A. M.
Bates. She was out wlth a sister this
morning and has not returned. The sister

        THE BOSTON SUBWAY
SATISFACTORY SOLUTION OF THE
STREET CAR PROBLEM.
Contention of Trafllc In tli? Iluny Streets
of the Uub Relieved by Underground |
Trolley Lines?Tunnels Tlmt Am Light, |
Clean uud Attractive.
It is now possible to cross Tromont
street, Boston, at any point opposite tho
Common and at any time of day without
loss of life or limb. Tho new subway has
brought about tho change.
It 1 s an old tradition that tho fathers of
Boston, when thoy laid out tho city, let
the. streets follow the winding cow paths.
At any rate, the streets ius thoy exist today
urc very crooked and must of them aro
very narrow. This was all right in Revo?
lutionary times, but when the city grow
miles beyond tho Common und spread it?
self out to tho south and west; when busi?
ness centered itself along tbu lower ends
of Washington and Trentont streets, and
when dozens of street car tracks usurped
tho narrow roadways, then the Bostonlans
wished their ancestors bud not stuck so
closely to the cow paths.
Probably no other city on the continent,
was ever so badly allllctcd with a conges?
tion of trnllic as tho Hub haslieon for
many yea: . . Some of tho most important
street ear linen skirt tho south and east,
cornets ol the Common on Boylston mid
Tremont streets. When I he chango was
made hum hoc. epov.vr to trolley, matters
grew worse. Then tho poles and the tan?
gle of overhead wires made that historic.
breathing spot look liko a pieco of dingy,
green billiard cloth which had become fray?
ed and tuttered around the edges. So after
much wrangling in tho legislature and
courts it w;ls decided tu build the subway
and put the trolley cars underground.
A large portion of the work bus already
lieen accomplished and Boston is delight?
ed with the result. The first thing a Hus?
ton man asks a visitor from Now York,
Chicago or elsewhere is:
"Been through tho subway yet'/ Let's
see?you huven't one in your place, have
you?"
It is, in fact, a triumph of engineering
anil well worth a visit. Then! arc throe
open cut.s where tho trolley curs enter the
subway. One Is out on Tremont street
whore Shawmut avenue comes in. Hero
the tracks from each of those jmorough
fares dive into the tunnel. Another is In
the Public gardens, where the cars com?
ing down Boylston street take tho under?
ground tlip. The third is at tho northerly
end of the subway, just beyond-Hay mar?
ket square and in front of the new Union
terminal railroad station into which the
Fitchburg, Hoston und Maine, Eastern
und other roads run. Theru is u. loop hern
DOSTON'S NEW SUBWAY INCLINE IN THE Plin
LIC JAKl)i;X.
ns most of the t rolley lines inako it their
terminus, and, the subway being four
tracked, they disgorge their passengers
and take the back track up town.
Including the inclines or open onto, tho
subway has a total length of 1 % miles and
will contain about live miles of track. At
present the branch down Boylston street
along the Common side and the main line
down Tremont to Park street are in oper?
ation. The Shawmut avenue branch and
tho northerly end of the main lino will be
finished within the next eight months.
Ground was broken for the subway in
April, 18115. The sum appropriated was
$7,ii(?0,000 and, wonderful to relate, tho
transit commissioners say that it is proba?
ble the cost will bo about $1,000,000 less
than that sum.
No groat difficulties have been encoun?
tered thus far in digging this big liplo In
the ground. Of course there were count?
less sewers, water pipes, gas pipes, electric
wire conduits and the like und some -III
inch water mains at an inconvenient level
proved rather hnrxl to handle, but n? un?
expected conditions arose to delay tho
work. The main trunk of the subway
runs under the wide walk or mall on tho
east side of the Common, anil when the
excavations were being made the bones of
hundreds of old Puritans were disturbed.
This raised a bowl of righteous Indigna?
tion,and the sncredness of the long forgot
burying ground was harped upon for
weeks. Hut the commissioners quieted
the reverent patriots by collecting nil tho
bones and roiuterrlng them in the holy
ground of the Common, with a nice monu?
ment to mark the spot.
The tleepest jioint of tho subway is on
Boylston street, where the south bound
t racks are laid lit) feet lielow the surface,
but the average depth is 14 feet. The tun?
nel itself is a giant bore with ribs of steel
mid casings! of cement, asphalt, concrete
and masonry. The roof is a series of
arches und the floor Is concave, with
drains at the bottom. As tho drnins are
below the level of the sewers, jilts have
been established at Intervals, and when
thev are filled with water automatic elec?
trical pumps are started, which empty
them Into tho sewers above.
Perhaps yon imagine that Boston's sub?
way is a tlark, damp, ill smelling place. It
is nothing of the sort. The entrances to
the stations aro handsome structures of
stone, with glass roofs. The only fault, to
be found with them is that thev remind

I that a road might have If It ran through Broad-

j ef all these advantages, three months' experi

popular, that people will not go Into It ex-
cept when they have to, and that the subway Is
lv a failure, save so far as It was a necosslty to re-
i'i Have the congestion of traffic on the street.
V XEED OF TUB BUDWAT.
A Bostonlans are proud of the subway. They
ri take strangers to see It, just as they take them
h to see Bunker IIIll Monument; make them ride
vM the length of It back and forth, and call alien
s' I tlon to all its fine foatures and then they keep
& I away from it themsolves. Just as thoydofrom

I V to New Yorkers there can be no doubt. Tho
?; building of tbo subway growoutof a publloneed
-., Tfhloh was as absolute and pressing as the need
v ef this city for some addition to Its trafllo
in. facilities.
Hien, about ten years ago. the West End
oet Railway Company began to transform tho
horso car lines of Boston Into electric trot
lines the narrow streets In tho heart of
iton were already choked with tho dally rush
vehicles. Boston has to-day tho most ex
stve and comprehensive electrlo car system
the world. The added cars which wero re
red for tho now service fairly filled
i streets of the little central city
ere they were all concentrated. These
' lines eorvo a suburban population of
trly a million persons, and it is possible to
;e a car for any part of the territory covered
.hoot going more thai a quarter of a mllo In .
i city. Under a special act of the Lcglsla
e the Boston Transit Commission was ap
nted to devise a suitable means to relieve the
Station.
THE OrERATIVB COWTnAOT.
fader this commission tho subway wns
nned and is being built. Tho city of Boston
s for it and leases it to tho West End Street
llway Company for twenty years at an an
il rental which is not to be less than 4Ts per
it. upon the net cost of the tunnel, or more
,n .Ts per cent, upon tho sum of $7,000,000,
he tunnol should cost so much, and tho com
ly agrees to pay. in llou of interest, a toll of
nts for each car that passes through the
way. In caso the aggregate of tolls should
:eed the interest charges. The railroad com
ly cares for it, lights it, ventilates it, ana
ips It free from wator. i
fork was bosun on the subway on March 28,
13, and on Sept. 1 of this rear the first scc
o was put Into use. A second socllon was put
o use on Sept. 30. The main part of tbo sub
y now in use lies usdor Tremont street, bo
sen Park street and Boylst:n street. This
lion 'Is 1,700 feet long and contains four
cks. At both ends aro stations, built
nmodlously under ground and approached
m the surface by wide, easy stair
ye. wulch are protected by small or
mental stone buildings. At the BoyI
in street station the tunnel divides into
o two-tracked sections. Ono of these con
ues under Tremont street for about 1,200
it, whon its comes to tho surfaco and empties
cars upon the tracks in Tremont street and
awmut avenue, which hero diverge. The
ler branch turns sharply to the wostward,
asunder the edge of tho famous Common, to
Public Oarden beyond Ohnrles street, where
comes to tho surfaco, 1,200 foet from the
ylston streot station, and its cars goon tholr
y down Boylston street,
man standahd or coxsTitucnos.
The tunnel Is kept almost as light as day
im end to end. At the stations It ls lined on
) sides with enamelled white brick. Through
t its length and on tho codings at tho
itlons It Is pnlnted white. At tlio su
ns and through the tunnol electric
hts aro hung In abundance, and to make
re that these shall not all fall at any ono tlnio
5y are divided nnd fed by two scparato clr
Its of wire, resides these lights, fixed In the
itnel, are the lights In tho passing cars, which
kept lit In making the tunnel passage. As
oorthreocarsaro passing In each direction
ery minute almost all the tliuo, their lights
me would keep it fairly well illuminated.
People doclare that they found the tunnel ro
ishlngly cool during the warm woather In Sep
nber Just after it was oponed, and In cold
lather they find It warm. No winds penetrato
and the moraont a porson gets to tho stairs at
itatlon he Is out of rench of storms. Only ono
jrce of discomfort has yet developed In tho
e of the tunnel, and that. It U belloved,
11 be remedied. This was, for the tlmo
lasted, a very groat trouble. It occurred
it month, when there had been a sudden
ange of 25 or 30 degrees in temperature,
oweathorhad been cold for thrco or four
ys, and the ground and tho Inside of tho tun
Ibadgotchillod until It was pretty nenrly as

isoln tlio general teniperaturo of 23 or 30
grees. Tbo warm air. drawn Into tho tunnol
the ventllnting fans, struck against the
lllod roof and sides, and Immediately every
log began to weep. The cold roof and sides of
e tunnel condensed tho moisture In the
irraer air, and In a short tlmo the
jole Interior glistened with molsturu.
. the stations tho condition was worst nnd pro
ced much discomfort. Here the air entered,
dof course gavo tin the greater part of its
ilsture. Most of tho moisture collected on tho
ling nnd dripped dnujion thn waiting passen
rs. People who had loft pleasant neathar
stairs found themselves exposed to trick
m streams below. It wns so bad that tbo
llroad company sot men to work scrnp

" One thing to be seen from theso Ilguros," Mr.
Llttlo added, " Is that tho sulmny, although It

'"Isn't this chnrnilngl' he exclaimed as he

"I admitted th-it It was; but when I camoto
look over tha tables of daily receipts and com
pare thom with the total tralllo I found that
although tho general trafllo had fallen off less
than 0 per cent, because of tbo rainy dny, tho
subway traffic had lost 30 per cent. This Is the
rooro significant from tho fact that one
half the former number of cars nro now oft tho
streets above."
A reference to tho dally tablos showed how '
tho travel In the subway fell off In unpleasant
weather. On Nor. 2, when tho usual dally
Irrffllc was 22,000 or 23,000 persons, only
14.000 went through tho subway. On Nov. 2a
tho number roll to 13,000, while tho next dny It
roso to 24,000. On Sundays, when tho tratllc
on nil parts of tho system ls fancy riding prin
cipally, tho number of passongers who go
through tbo subway falls as low as 0,000.
FACT8 FOR NEW YORK TO 1-0NDER,
These aro tho facta. If It wcro possible to
build tbo long tunnel proposed for this city nnd
mal.o all parts of It ns perfect ns tho Boston
subway, which is at least doubtful, what would
be thn effect of an oqual Indisposition of Now
Yorkers to using it upon tho chances of Its pay
ing I Tho proposed road would have enough to
contend with through tho location of its main
linos out of tho way of tho short-ride local
business, out of which alone profit ls to
be made; but If the fancy traffic avoided It, ns
It avoids the lloston subway, tho result would
bo ruinous, Tho contractors would find them
selves with no ono to carry except tho people
who wanted to ride to Harlem and far above
or to Klngsbrldge, all for fire cents, and. what
ever forfeit they had to make, they would soon
abandon tho lino for thn city to operate at a loss.
CACHES OF rUPLIC PREJUDICE.
Why the peoplo avoid tho subway Is a ques
tion much discussed. Perhaps as good nn ex
planation ns anr Is to bo found in a conversa
tion which took place between Tun Sun re
porter who gathered these fncts nnd the pretty
&lrl who Owns the news stnnd at one of Boston's
est hotels.
"Ilavo you beon through the subway yet I"
ho asked enthusiastically.
"Yes," the reporter nnswored.
"I have just been through It, Isn't It grand!"
she exclaimed.
"l)o you go through it of ten I" asked tho re
porter curiously.
"Ob, no!" Bho answered. "I think It's beau
tiful, so light, and dry, and comfort bio: but I
always take a surfaco car. I think I hate to
walk up the stairs, although I am not lazy. I
walk clear out to ltoxbury and back almost
ever' day, and have lost slxteon pounds by
doing so, but, somehow, I don't llko to go up and
down stairs In tho subway."
It ls probably something more than this thnt
deters people from going underground even In a
tunnel bo well lighted. It is well known thnt
the underground roads In London do not pay,
nnd this ls duo largely to tho lack of tho fnncy
trafflc, such as overflows surface lines and ele
vated roads In New York. Ask a Londoner If
he uses tho underground roads in his own city
much, and IiIb answer Is almost suro to bo:
"Oh, yes, but only when lhavo to."
NOW BOSTON WANTS AN ELEVATED ROAD.
That Boston has awakened to the fact that
subways arc not n good thing whero they can be
avoided. Is clear from the character of tho very
latest move now on foot there. This ls to build
elevated railroads from tho ends of the subway,
nnd thus, in thoopen air, enrry tho cars out be
yond the thickly built-UD sections to Rnx
bury, Cambridge, Cbarlestown, and be
jond. This plan ls to be carried out ns
soon as tho Stato Railroad Commission agrees
to a lease of the West End road's lines to the
new elevated railroad company.

into a panic nnd paralyzed trnfflc ln

No one know the trouble. Elevatcd
road employes and offlclals were allke
confused, and fearful of what mlght
come next, fla tho smoko raphlly fllleil
tho stntloim at Boylston and Park
streets, nnd passengers wers rushed
from tlie cars to the surfacc.
Tralnmen nnd statlon pollce at
tempted to call the flrd departmont
and found tho telephones so charged
wlth clectrlclty as to be useless.
Mnny of the women reachlng the
subway by the Boylston street cars
were overcomo by the smoko, falnted,
nnd had to be dragged to the surfnce.
Several becanio hysterlcal and woro

danger belng constant of Bomeono
falllng from tho platforms overcome
by tho smoko and becomlng electro
cuted upon the deadly thlrd rall.
Tralnmaster Benjamln wns the flrst
offlclal to reach the Boylston street
statlon and to brlng some sort of or-
der out of tho cliaos. Enterlng the
subway along the llne of the north
bound cars he made hla way some 100
feet to the south of tlie statlon and
found the cause of the trouble.
. The feed cables for the thlrd rall,
runnlng between the ralla and en
closed ln four-inch wooden box con
dults, were found grouuded and
throwlng off flashes of electrlclty,
whlch llluminnted the subway for
tnany hundreds of feet. The electrl
clty had jumped to other cables run
nlng parallel, and even charged the
wnlla of the subway. Ten powerful
cables felt the lnftuence of the crosn
nnd were cracklng nnd throwlng off
flames and flashes of llght, threaten
Ing death to any who cnme near.
Tho wooden box condtilt, black and
greasy and very Inflammable, was
burnlng rapldly. A north bound traln
whlch had passed over the spot got
nflro nnd wna inillod bnnk lo Waont
street, hlnzlng flercely underneath.
Tlie terrlfled passengers were hnnied
ntt nt Plpnsnnt Rtreet nnd tlie flro be-
nnivth tho. .. Kttn"gulshed by'road
employes before serlous damage was
done.
Three persons were hurt, nnd all of
them were on the surface. The nccl
dents whlch caused thelr Injurles were
the dlrect result of the trouble In tbo
subway. The Injured wero all near
the Pleasant street entrance to tho
Biibwny and were hurt by the explo
sions in three mnnholes at tliat polnt.
Tralnmaster Benjamln ordered all
tralns Into statlons, and then the cnr-
rent on the thlrd rall and feed cables
was shut off.
Chlef Mullcn and the flre depart
ment hod been notlfled before tho
power was shut off and entered tho
nubway nt the Boylston street sta
tlon, although there was great danger
for anyone, however famlllar ylth the
subway, to enter ln tlie dense smoke
whlch flllcd every foot of space be
tween the walls.
As Chlef Mullen's men toucbed the
walls thoy felt a shock at once. The
brass nozzle of the chemlcal hose
Ihey carrled became charged, and wlth
electrlclty runnlng up thelr arms the
men hcsltated for a mlnute for orders
from thelr chlef.
rlsk It," shouted Chlef Mull
en, and he dashed Into the smoko
filled subway. Hla men followed close
behlnd, thelr hands on the shoulders
of the men In front. A few darlng
newspaper men brought up the rear.
Half an hour was consumed ln put
llng out the flames whlch had fol
lowed nlong the box condults nearly
300 ynrds.
Both Chlef Mullen and Aaslstant
Chlef Brady termed It one of the
most dangerous flres they were ever
called upon to hnndle, not from lts In
tenslty but for the dangers of electro
cutlon that surrounded them and the
thlckness of the smoke.

Thomas
Lawson's Confidential Man
Dies In Subway.
Boston, Dec. 1. John F. Donohue,
many years the confidential man of J.
Edward Addicks aud of Thomas W.
Lawsou, committed suicide by throw-!
lng himself before a fast moving train ,
in the subway. Deatli was install Ui- i
neous.
For about fifteen minutes Mr. Dono
hue had been pacing the station plat
form, walking to tho edge and looking
down at the rails and peering up and
down the track. Just before a north
bound train drew up Mr. Donohue
dropped a light cane lie had been car
rying and jumped into the train pit
His family furnished no explanation
for the act. Friends say he had been
suffering from stomach trouble about
a year. He was sixty years old and a
native of Ireland and for a time was
engaged lu shoe manufacturing In
Lynn, Mass.
Mr. Donohue was known as "Law
son's Man Friday." About three years
ago he broke with Lawson nnd filed a
suit for $250,000 against him, assert
ing that amount was due him for con
fidential services for a long period.
Among tho thirty-three specifications
in the suit was the delivery to Law
son of the books of the Bay State Gas
Companies of Delaware and New Jer
sey. This, he said, enabled Lawson to
make terms to his advantage with tho
late Henry H. Itogers.
He also said that he had arranged

        <text>BOSTON'S SUBWAY, SURFACE AND ELEVATED LINES
PRACTICALLY TIED UP BY STRIKE
Boston, June 7. By noon to
day the surface, elevated and sub
way car system of Boston and
suburbs was utterly disorganized.
A strike of the union employes
of the Boston Elevated, which
controls the surface and subway
lines, was called at 4:15 o'clock
this morning after a stormy three
hour session at union headquar
ters. The elevated officials laughed
at the strike. When the union was
formed only a few weeks ago the
elevated set about a counter or
ganization, a "protective" asso
ciation they called it.
This morning the officials of
the company claimed they had
2,000 men in this protective asso
ciation who would continue to
work, and that they had 1,500
strike-breakers already imported
from New York and Philadelphia.
There was a good deal of riot
ing after the strike was called.
Cars wer.e stoned, trolleys discon
nected, motormen and conductors
who refused to recognize the
strike order roughly handled,
le,epers were put on the tracks,
and cautious Bostonians walked
to work this morning.
But the rioting never became
very serious and it was not neces
sary. As the forenoon wore on
motormen after motormen, and
conductor after conductor left
their 'packed cars standing'in the
street and went to union head
quarters to report.
Even wherfe they did not leave
the cars there always was some
one to disconnect the trolley
wires. Then the motormen and
conductors would refuse to get
off to fix it, and the police would
have to do it.
Because the guards at the
Park street terminal of the Cam-
bridge subway reported to the
union the escalators were stopped
and passengers had to climb three
flights of stairs to the street.
There are 3,800 members of the
union. The strike was called be
cause :
The company refused to recog
nize the union; announced it
would employ no union .men.
When complaints were made
against men, they were laid off
without pay pending a hearing.
If exonerated and reinstated,
the pay they lost never was made
up. i
Conductors were forced to fur
nish $10 change for each trip.
Despite the company's refusal
of an increase because their
"finances wquld not stand it,"
the "loyal federation or protec
tive asspciation" members' pay
was increased when the union
was formed.
Police Commissioner O'Meara
ordered all the reserves on duty
at the subway and elevated, sta
tions and car barns this forenoon.
There already have been fifty arm
rests, but all the cases were con
tinued until oMnday.

BOSTON, July 21 Traffic on the surface, ' 'bway

after an interruption of f our days caused by tht yike
of Carmen who demanded an eight hour day and l. in
crease in wages. They were granted an eight hou .g. uy
and an increase in wages, the maximum being 62 & '-s
an hour.The decision was the resui tA ,
three arbitrators James H. Vancy
for the Carmen; H. Warc Barnum for
the Elevated trustees and Henry B.
Endicott, the neutral member. The
rcport of the award was read to the
carmen on Boston Common and was
received with acclaim. The new wagc
scale is l'etro-activc to May first.
The wage scale was agrced upon
after an ali day confercnce at tlT5
State House and in the Hotel Tou
raine. It falls considerably short of
the fiat wage of 73 cents an hour
which formed the basis of the car
mcn's demands. The scale is grad
uated from 47 cents an hour to bo
ginners as recruit brakemen on rapid
transit lines, to 62 cents an hour for
motormen on the game lines.
The arbitrators also reward an
eight-hour platform day, suggesting
a variation which will permit three
fìfths between 11 and 14 hours.

without pay pending a hearing.
If exonerated and reinstated,
the pay they lost never was made
up. i
Conductors were forced to fur
nish $10 change for each trip.
Despite the company's refusal
of an increase because their
"finances wquld not stand it,"
the "loyal federation or protec
tive asspciation" members' pay
was increased when the union
was formed.
Police Commissioner O'Meara
ordered all the reserves on duty
at the subway and elevated, sta
tions and car barns this forenoon.
There already have been fifty arm
rests, but all the cases were con
tinued until oMnday.

as a settled fact that the work will be vigor

TO GO TO HARVARD
Special Committee Recoin
mentis Extension of
Boston System,
Cambridge, Mas?., March 31.—If the
Cambridge city council favors the re
port of the special committee on rapid

means of rapid transit from Cambridge
to Boston, the subway to extend from
I.afayette Square to Harvard Square.
The committee will favor giving the
road a long tenure and will agree to
a location in Harvard Square instead

act of 1SS7.
