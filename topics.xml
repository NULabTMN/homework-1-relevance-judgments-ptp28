        <text>THE GOLD FIELDS OF ALASKA
          Since the acquisition of Alaska in 1867 public attention in regard to it has been mainly directed to the salmon fisheries in its waters and to the seal rookeries in Behring sea. The value of the country as a dependency has been wholly determined by the public from the rental which the Priboloff islands yield to the national treasury. Few references in the intervening period have been made by public journals and in the periodical literature of the country to the gold-yielding capabilities of Alaska, or to the degree of development already reached.
  The truth is that hundreds of thousands of intelligent Americans are profoundly ignorant of the fact that some of the largest and most profitable gold mining enterprises within the limits of the United States are conducted in Alaska.
  Gold in variable quantities and under different conditions has been found in three principal districts of Alaska-the
  Juneau and Douglass Island district, 180 miles northeast of Sitka and bordering Gasteneaux channel, a narrow inlet which separates Douglass island from the mainland; the Sitka district, the quartz deposits of which are found at Silver bay, a narrow, tortuous arm of the Pacific, indenting Baranoft island, and in the valley of the Yukon river in western Alaska. Gold bearing quartz has also been found at Unga island, one of the smaller of the Aleutian group, and some egort has been made there at development, but more of that hereafter.
  As concerns the Yukon valley, little attention has been paid by explorers and prospectors to discover gold bearing
  quartz, and the only results, so far, relate to placer mining. At the head of Lynn canal, one of the inner passages adapted to steamer navigation, about 300 miles northeast of Sitka, is the mouth of the Chilcatl river, navigable for canoes for a score of miles. At the head of this canoe navigation are three large Chilcatl villages, and it is at this point where commences what is known as the Chilcatl Portage, across the range to the head waters of the Yukon river in
  British territory. The distance from the Indian villages on the American side of the divide to the first lake, the source of the Yukon, is about thirty miles, but the source is one of the most difficult in the territory, yet the only practicable one to reach the Yukon valley from the south. During the past three years the reports that the bars of the Yukon and its tributaries, Stewart and Pelly rivers, and Forty-Mile creek were rich in placer gold, have induced several Alaska miners to venture across the range, at the Chilcatl crossing and descend these streams. Several parties are all known to have perished in this perilous search for the new gold fields. 
  In the history of gold mining in the states and territories, no obstacle was so stubborn that it was not finally over-come. This, too, will be the history of the gold fields of western Alaska. Army officers who have served in the territory at various times, are now endeavoring to induce congress to authorize an exploration of the Yukon Valley from its source to its mouth, and express a willingness to undergo the evident hardships and privations of such an undertaking. The reports of the fertility of certain large portions of that great valley, and respecting its agricultural possibilities are so conflicting and uncertain, that it can hardly be regarded as an absolute waste of money to authorize an intelligent official examination of those valleys to that end.
  The permanent development of gold mining in Alaska has been made in the southeastern part of the territory, which embraces all that strip of mainland, thirty miles wide from Portland channel at the southern boundary to the vicinity of Mt. St. Elias and including the islands of the Alexandrian Archipelago, which hug the mainland closely from south to north and west. The topography of this section is characteristic and remarkable. The thirty-mile strip of mainland belonging to the United States is no more than an unbroken range of very, steep and lofty mountains, the summits of many of which are never free from snow. No valleys separate or break the continuity of these ranges. At intervals short, swift streams, fed by the interior glaciers, have worn down waterways to the bays and inlets, but these streams, in most instances, are only wild cascades. Rarely one finds the gorge, the streambed, wider than a space sufficient for the passage of the water; and in attempting to ascend to their sources, one is confronted by tierce torrents impossible to stem, and with no margin by their sides, along which to pass around the cataracts. Frequently the last leap is made only a few rods from the point where the river enters the sea, and this is even the rule. All the islands off the coast southern Alaska, Baranoft, Admiralty, Douglass and Prince of Wales are simply mountains rising out of the Pacific, whose interiors are vast glacial formations, while their fronts to the sea are clothed with timber. No white men has ever been heard of having crossed either of these islands, and the Indians disclaim ever having attempted it, preferring the easier mode of passing around them in their canoes.
  The faces of the mountains toward the water, on the mainland and on the islands of southeastern Alaska, are very steep, almost perpendicular, and covered with a deep, spongy bog or tundra, which is always wet or moist. They are also covered with forests of fir, spruce, hemlock, yellow cedar and & scrub birch and alder, up to the snow-line, and this undergrowth of birch, salmon berry, alder and devil's club makes everywhere almost impassible thickets and jungles. These topographical conditions must be borne in mind constantly, in considering the mining development and possibilities of Alaska, for they figure largely in estimating the present progress of the industry.
  Gold quartz was first discovered in the territory in 1877, near Silver Bay, in the vicinity of Sitka. The discoverer, Mr.
  Haley, was a soldier discharged from the regular army, and previous to his enlistment, had mined in Colorado and California. Numerous quartz lodes are located in the vicinity of his discovery, which is about three miles back from the beach, and far up the side of the mountain. Haley opened several tunnels and exposed valuable quartz, and succeeded in selling two of his discoveries for fifteen thousand dollars. 
  The proprietors of another lode some distance from the original discovery put up a five-stamp mill; but for the want of adequate capital to place the enterprise on a square footing, conjoined with feeble and incompetent management, the project went to pieces, the mill was sold by the marshal and is now corroding to ruin in the rain and snow. Another company, organized under the laws of Wisconsin, have become the owners of the "Lucky Chance," and with a five-stamp mill are making satisfactory milling tests, preparatory to a liberal and adequate investment in a plant coming year. Water for power in that group is abundant all the year round, and owing to the mildness of the winters at Sitka, through the trend of the Japan current, milling operations will seldom if ever be interrupted by freezing weather. Ore has been taken out of ledges in the Sitka group, yielding $40 a ton; but numerous tests made demonstrate that the fair average is about $10 a ton. All the work and exploration done up to this time, in this basin, has been of the crudest, most careless and unsatisfactory character. No definite policy of prospecting and exploration in any part of the territory has ever been adopted, and where discoveries have been made they were merely accidental.
  Those owning and controlling these valuable interests have hitherto been unable to inspire that confidence in the future of their properties which is necessary to induce capital to even closely investigate their value and possibilities.
  The manner of developing this and other similar mining localities in Nebraska will be referred to again, when considering the larger and more thoroughly worked mining district of Juneau and Douglass Island. It is to the latter that we must look for the most satisfactory results, and by noting what has already been accomplished in that field, possibly predict whether the gold yield of Alaska will be permanent and profitable, or only fitful and spasmodic.

  Juneau and Douglass Island are 180 miles northeast of Sitka, and reached from the latter place by the inner passages of Peril and Catham straits, und Gasteneaux channel, which separates Douglass island from the mainland. In 1880, that section of southern Alaska was without a single white inhabitant, and was one of the most forbidding portions of the earth. In October of that year Mr. N. A. Tuller, in charge of the affairs of the Northwest trading company at Sitka, became aware of the fact that Auk and Tarku Indians, whose villages were on the mainland at Gasteneaux  channel, possessed a tradition of the existence of gold in some of the deep basin of the mountains in that vicinity. One particular basin was designated as containing abundance of this treasure. Having faith in the story, Fuller fitted out a canoe expedition for the purpose of testing his belief. It was intrusted to a Canadian French miner, Joseph Juneau, the nephew of the founder of Milwaukee, and who had visited all the gold mines from Arizona and Old Mexico in the south, to Cassiar, in British Columbia, in the north. Juneau was accompanied by two Sitkan Indians as guides, and after ten days of a tempestuous canoe voyage up Chatham Straits, landed near the site of the present town now bearing his name, and proceeded to follow the difficult course of Gold creek, the outlet to Silver Bow basin, until he reached the head of a gulch filled with glacier ice. Passing down the gulch, Juneau discovered some quartz laid bare and protruding into the ravine, and an examination showed at once that it was rich in gold, so rich that the free gold was apparent in many places where the rock was fractured. Claims were staked off, the party returned to Sitka, and reported their success to Mr. Fuller. The secret could not be long kept. Before spring had fairly opened several hundred miners were on the ground, and the nucleus of a prosperous mining camp created. 
  When the snow disappeared from the basin , with its area of a thousand acres or more , with mountain walls for its steep sides , it was found that centuries of erosion had created in that contracted area one of the richest placer mines
  over worked. Though of limited area it equaled in richness many of the old California placers.
  No civil government was formed in Alaska until more than three years afterward , but in the spring of 1881 the 250 hardy old minors who had explored nearly every region where gold had hitherto been found, met and adopted a code of mining laws which became obligatory upon every miner in the district.
  Half a dozen beautiful glacial streams poured from the sides of the mountains, hemming in Silver Bow basin and feeding the rapid torrent of Gold crook , furnished abundance of water for gold washing, and before that summer ended fully $1,000 in gold dust had been taken out, and still only a meagre impression made, Quite $1,000,000 in dust have been washed out of the sand and dirt of that one basin in the intervening years, and the surface is now practically worked out. Pay gravel exists, however to a considerable depth on the floor of the basin, and a now company has run a tunnel through one of the environing ridges, for the purpose of mining by the hydraulic process. Two stamp mills are also in operation upon quartz the mine ground, and a roadway, two and a half miles long, and costing $13,000 has been completed, so as to connect the mines with the channel beach. A flourishing town of 1,500 white inhabitants has grown up about this mining location, with schools , churches and many of the comforts of civilization.
  The development of mining on that portion of the mainland of south-eastern Alaska has just fairly commenced. Every indication points to the inexhaustible character of the gold quartz deposits, and though there is nothing of a high grade, or of fabulous richness, yet it is manifest that mining carried on bore with adequate capital, ample plants and conservative methods insures that this section of Alaska will have indefinite period of prosperity as a mining district. Farther on I shall speak of what is requisite in order to make the handling of these low grade ores of Alaska remunerative.
  About three miles to the eastward of the town , and up the gulch of Snoop's Creek, recent discoveries of quartz have
  also been made , equaling those in Siver Bow Basin. No mills have been yet erected to work these deposits of gold-
  bearing rock , but considerable quantities have been shipped to Seattle and Portland, and refilled with fair profits to
  the owners of the mines. Though explorations have been frequently made to discover silver in the territory, none was
  found until the winter of 1888 , when a fine rich voin of galena was discovered in the Sheep's Creole gulch already
  alluded to. It is reported by credible persons as having yielded $130 per ton In the smelter at Portland.
  Soon after the gold discoveries on the mainland at Juneau , prospectors crossed over to Douglas Island, only two miles distant. Here was found abundance of placer gold, on the face of the mountain which rises directly out of the water at nearly all points along the shore, but at this particular place recedes from the beach, leaving a stretch of low land more than a mile long and a few hundred foot wide. While some were engaged in washing the dirt, others began to search for quartz lodes In the same vicinity, and on the face of the same mountain. The indications wore fair, but putting in the necessary tunnels for exploration was expensive and those engaged soon became discouraged. John
  Treadwell , who had been a successful contractor and builder in San Francisco, was attracted to Alaska by exaggerated tales of fabulous bonanzas, and touching at Douglas Island, found the owners to several quartz claims ready to abandon their rights, fully disheartened. Treadwell purchased their interests and improvements for a small
  amount, and with faith, energy and resources pushed the explorations already begun to a conclusion.
  For many months ho was the butt of every old miner's ridicule in all that region. At last he pierced a ledge of gold bearing rock 400 feet wide, over 800 feet deep from the surface and more than 9,000 feet in length from east to west. This, in fact, became the great Treadwell gold mine, now operated by the Alaska Mining and Milling company. He was soon able to convince capitalists that he had something in which it would pay to invest, and the company was organized in 1881, with Senator Jones of Nevada and D.C. Mills of Now York, he principal shareholders. 
  A mill with 120 stamps was erected in a few months, and the mill and chlorination works on a grand scale put in operation. Two largo ditches, one ten miles long to the westward, along the face of the mountain, and the other to the cast, five miles in length, wore constructed with great difficulty and expense, owing to the tundra character of the surface, to convoy water to the mill as a motive power. A pressure of 700 feet , through iron pipes twenty inches in diameter, was communicated to a wheel of eight feet in diameter, by which all those ponderous stamps, 2,000 pounds each, and the other machinery, were set in motion and did their work. For two years the mill and works wore kept in constant operation, no cessation night or day, during the week. Early in 1888 the capacity of the stamp mill was expanded, and the number of stamps increased to two hundred and forty, making the largest mill of the kind under one roof In the world. The policy of keeping the establishment in constant operation remains unchanged, and since its increase incapacity, there has been a stoppage of only one day. During the summer of 1889 , fifteen miles were added to the ditch for water supply, and to intercept additional streams as they came down the mountain side to the sea. During the winters of 1887 and 1888, there was no interruption of the supply of water by cold weather, for motive power, but to guard against any contingency of that that kind , a powerful Corliss engine has been provided to drive the great mass of machinery at such times. The winters at Douglass island are seldom so severe that the rapid, fresh-water torrents freeze over and deprive the mill of its full supply. In December , 1889, there was some difficulty in that respect, and the Corliss engine was doing the work of the waterwheel. The Treadwell is not a mine in the strict sense. The rock is taken out of an open quarry and convoyed to the mill less than five hundred feet distant on a tramway. Its capacity Is 650 tons every twenty-four hours. The profits of the establishment are, of course, the company's own secret, but exports acquainted with this quartz and other conditions, put the average yield per ton at $10 and the cost of extracting the metal, at from $4 to $4.50 per ton. By the amalgam process, all the free gold which passes from the stamps to the concentrators is recovered, while the residue, in the form of sulphurets; is manipulated by roasting and chlorination in the vast wooden building which stands several hundred yards nearer the beach than the stamp mill.
  This company owns 9,000 lineal feet or six quartz claims in length, from east to west , and while in four years of constant movement, an enormous cavity in the side of the mountain has been created, the indications are that the supply of rock, at the present rate of production, will hold out for a quarter of a century yet. A line electric light
  plant enables the operatives to work by night in the mill , and in the chlorination works and the mine. Four
  hundred men arc employed in various duties about the mine, stamp mill, chlorination work, stores, and saw and planning mills , which the company operates as part of its mining and mining plant. About one-third of the operatives are Indians or natives of Alaska. The latter are an industrious, frugal and reliable class of mining employes, and receive the same wages as white men engaged in the same class of work. Indians are largely employed not
  only at the salmon canneries in southeastern Alaska as fishermen, but in nearly all the mining operations of that section of the territory. No antagonism exists between them and white labor, and their relations are of the most cordial character. The white minors in southeastern Alaska do not permit Chinamen to engage in that class of work , and coolies are only found on the inside, all the salmon canneries, always going below at the end of the season.
  Early last year work was begun on the "Bear's Nest", a mining claim which was sold to an English syndicate in the fall of 1888 for $2,000,000. It is located about half a mile west of the Treadwell, and was sold on the strength of its good neighborhood, and upon the results of diamond drill tests. After a tunnel had penetrated the hillside for 1,000 feet, and about $70,000 had been expended toward erecting a stamp mill , and other parts of the requisite plant, they failed to strike the ledge which was doomed to be a westward prolongation of the rich and extensive lode constituting the Treadwell. Operations have been suspended, and litigation to determine whether the sale was a fraudulent transaction, the salting of a mine , or whether the failure to roach a paying ledge was the result of operative blundering has been begun. The mere fact that an enterprise starting out with so much of promise failed in the very midst of the brightest anticipations, will , most certainly, produce a chilling effect upon all present attempts to inaugurate new mining enterprises in Alaska. The Mexican company, a corporation with abundant resources, however, is vigorously prohibiting Its explorations at an equal distance to the eastward of the Treadwell , in the hope and confidence , and with every prospect of intercepting the prolongation of the Treadwell ledge. Rich deposits of gold-bearing quartz have also been discovered on Admiralty island, in the same group as Douglass island, and the stamp mills are in course of erection there also.
  The discovery of coal near the beach, and easy of access by water transportation at Cook's inlet, Unga island and at
  other available points on the coast of western Alaska , will have an important bearing not only on the general commercial importance of the territory, but upon its gold and silver mining enterprises, coal, when used In the latter industry, is now only attainable at Departure bay, British Columbia , and with the enormous cost, of coal freights under the present arrangement of transportation the work of development is more or less retarded. 
  One word more with respect to the future of gold mining In Alaska, as far as discoveries extend, the ores are of a
  low grade. This will requite that they be handled In large plants with capital in large mass, owing to the policy pursued
  by the company operating the Treadwell mine. In addition to that, the management must be of an intelligent character and not mere inexpert experiments by unskillful adventurers. Under such conditions Alaska , through its gold mines , will be n source of great wealth to the entire country.

        <text>THE RUSH TO YUKON
          The rush Into the Yukon has already begun. The fest party of miners to take the trail left Juneau about the middle of January. There were nine men In the party. This is an unusually early start for miners. A good many others in town are wetting ready for the trip, intending to tackle the range about the middle of March. Every steamer that comes in from below now brings party of old-timers and crowds of now men all anxious to get in and get to work. The Yukon country in almost certain to be overcrowded this summer, surely as regards winter supplies, unless large outfits are taken in from here by the miners.
From all accounts received here from sections along the Pacific coast and In the East Alaska is destined to receive a rush of people this summer which will not be consistent with the present progress and the amount of work now going on. Alaska at present can support so many people and no more, and if the rush pans out according to present prospects there Is likely to be considerable hardship. Alaska has no industries except mining at which the wage earner can make a decent livelihood, and unless a man has sufficient means to carry him through, either in some business or for a season's prospecting, he had better steer clear of this country. It requires some capital to prospect for a mining claim, and when the claim is found it requires more capital to open It up. Gold nuggets do not grow on bushes, and It takes both a man's hands and his pockets to get the yellow metal in this country. There's an almighty lot of at here, but it isn't to be had for the asking. It is perhaps timely now to tell something explicit about the way of getting into the Yukon and the difficulties of the trip. No one should think of coming to Alaska who has not perfect health and has not, moreover, a more than ordinarily strong constitution, to enable him to withstand the atmospheric and climatic changes. In the Yukon district the thermometer has an annual range of 180°. There Is a time in the short summer when it ranges about 110° above zero, and in the winter it frequently goes to 70°  below, and sometimes more. No one should come to Alaska who has not some practical knowledge of quartz and placer mining. Theories are all right in their way, and the theorist may stumble upon something good, but it is the practical prospector who gets the Alaskan nugget every time. Every unfavorable report of Alaska mines can be traced directly to some disappointed tenderfoot who thought he could come up here and pick the gold off the bushes. Most of them didn't like it because they found they couldn't get nuggets as easily as they could salmon berries. Anybody can tell gold after the smelter gets through with it, but it isn't so easy to know where to look for and how to find it.
If you are contemplating making the trip into the Yukon you want to give careful consideration to these things: The length of time you will have to stay in the country, the amount of money it will take, and the results which may be attained. Briefly, these things are: Time, three years; money, $500; results, unlimited. Little can be accomplished in less than three years' stay in the Yukon unless the prospector has marvelously good luck. A good part of the first season will be consumed in reaching the mines. Then if claim is discovered and located only preliminary work can be done. The second year the mine can be opened up well, and probably some money can be made. The third year is when the prospector may reasonably expect to get his profits.
No man ought to make the start into the Yukon basin with less than $500 above what he expects to spend for the outfit which shall carry him through to the diggings. That is, if he goes in by way of Juneau and over the pass, he wants to have $500 when he gets to Forty Mile or Circle City, or wherever it is he is going. It he goes by the way of St. Michael's and up the Yukon he wants to have just the same money.

The road Is a long one whichever way he goes. Supplies are expensive. The season is short, and fortune Is fickle. Failure to find gold the first season is likely to entail great hardship upon those whose funds are insufficient at the start. Not one in a hundred makes a paying strike the first season. The trading companies in the interior find a quick market for all their goods at spot cash prices, and they refuse absolutely give credit. Their supply is almost invariably behind the demand. These are the cold-blooded facts and if you haven't got the money to meet them you had better not try to go into the Yukon basin looking for a fortune. You won't get it. But if you've got the money, and if you are strong and healthy and ambitious and are a practical prospector, and if you've got good grit, why, come along. Here's the 1 place where you can make a pile. There's lots of it up here, and such men are digging it. It is estimated that they dug out In the Yukon district, in the last season upward of $800,000, and that isn't a patch on what's there.

j Alaska. Along the southwest- j
s erly shore line the mines and j
fisheries would afford perma- j
nent occupation to a large pop
ulation. We want men who will come
with their families and make our land
their permanent abode. When homes
are established then will our future be
assured. At present I scarce believe
that the entire white resident popula
tion of Alaska exceeds 10,000.
But before there can be much immi
gration to Alaska there must be an
extension of the land laws. At present
a purchaser can secure no title to
property. The only deed is a quit
claim. He'll get off and you set on.
We have been living in this way for
thirty years.
The mining laws of the United States
have been extended to Alaska, but not
the land laws. Why, every man who
cuts a stick of timber is a trespasser.
The people realize that they are there
on suffrage, and there is no attempt to
cut timber for export out of the coun
try.
The poor man has an equal chance
with the capitalist so far as mining in
the southern s -tion is concerned. Of
course, when it comes to outfitting,
paying for transportation into the Yu
kon district, the man of limited means
is practically barred.
But I believe that the rush into the
Klondike will soon be diverted. As
Governor I receive hundreds of letters
seeking information regarding the
country. I have noted that many of*
these letters inquire about chances in
the Copper River and Cooks Inlet dis
tricts, showing that an increasing
number of people are now turning their
eyes in those directions, because they
believe in their mineral wealth and
because they are on American soil. We
anticipate -I great rush there, and
while it might be for a time a tran
sient addition to the population of the
country it will mean somewhat of a
permanent settlement later on.
At no distant day I believe there will
be what may be termed "the Alaska
farmer." As a result of my twenty
years' experience in this northern
country I have no hesitancy in saying
that it possesses superior agricultural
advantages to my old Indian stamping
ground. I now raise fine garden truck,
beef cattle, and am able to raise pigs
with little difficulty. It is some trouble
to get feed, but there is plenty of grass.
The western islands and Cooks Inlet
are covered with grass four feet high.
Some day there will be a farming pop
ulation in Cooks Inlet.
The transition in Alaska will be from
gold to coal and from coal to agricul
ture. I have heard it said that the Yu
kon Valley offers a field for barley un
surpassed anywhere in the world, even
though the soil one foot or eighteen
inches below the surface is eternally
frozen.
The fish Industry is one of the great
est interests in Alaska. The business
last year amounted to $3,000,000, but it
needs to be regulated by a commission.
The cannery men should be called to
gether in conference to decide the many
questions which should be settled where
a fierce rivalry exists. All sides could
be heard, and more intelligent laws
than those now governing would re
sult. There are a number of instances
I could give of the necessity of a com
mission. '-*;%
There is now an absence of Govern
ment machinery, which makes lt Im
possible for even constituted officials
to enforce their authority.
Think of the future of the fish Indus
try! The grounds on the Atlantic
coast are giving out,' while ours are un
touched. Some day a majority of the
fish consumed in the world will come
from Alaska. ■ . ,% **?
The fur industry has seen its best
days. On the western islands foxes,
blue and silver, are being cultivated,
and I understand those interested in
the venture are having good success. *
I do not believe that Alaska has a
large enough permanent population to
warrant the creating of a Territory.
I do, however, favor the appointment
of a commission to visit Alaska and
frame new laws for its government.
The business men and officials of
Alaska are concerned in effecting some
change or amplification of the laws
at present in force. They ought to
confer and submit to Congress a prop
osition to authorize the appointment
of a commission which can consider on
the ground the needs of Alaska My
idea is that the commission should
consist of a Senator, a Representative
and three bona-fide Alaskans. If we
are ever able to get such a commission
something would be accomplished for
the practical good of Alaska. Other
wise the time devoted by Congress to
Alaska will be frittered away in the
consideration of numerous individual
bills of.no benefit to the country as a
whole. This man will want a right of
way; that one certain privileges.
Each bill will be lobbied and pushed,
to the exclusion of more general mea
sures, with the result that Alaska will
stand where she
, stood for the last \
thirty years. The !
work of Congress j
will be fruitless I
and the simple
laws we need will
remain unenacted.

a rush to California in the old days. There was a /
rush to Melbourne. I remember from time to •
time running across men who had been to /
the gold fields. None of them had broughf
away any gold at all. What they did bring
away was rheumatism, bent bodies, creak

that, I think, in some form or other, will be
the portion of most of the Klondike dig

the American outfitters, who will reap all
the harvest for themselves. If I were
younger I would go to look at the place
and the people. Alas! I cannot. It is
no use recommending young novelists
to go, because, no doubt, they are pre

were three young novelists. They all I
resolved— each thinking himself "the i

the scene of a novel certain to have a
most enormous boom. They all thought
they would start in March— this all hap

ferent boats; one by the Allan line, so as
to get local color in Canada; one by the
Cunard line, because they have never lost
a passenger; and one by the White Star,
because it was handy. They all got out
West— far West, to British Columbia, where
the start is made; on the morning of the
start they met; face to face they met. Thej

At a well-known
mechanics* insti
tute in the north
of England the
chair, at a recent
lecture by a dis
tinguished clergy
man, was taken
by an Alderman
who had made
most of his money
and reputation in
the grocery busi

atta inments in
theology had not
soared above the
Bible and church
hymnal. Hence,
when he announc

would now de

"The Canon; Its
Composition and Place In History,"
and went on to say that it was most
important , nowadays, with our com
mercial interests, that we should be
quite up to date with all military and
naval knowledge, etc., the audience
was immensely tickled.
Ing happened. On the third day one of , them, who had been
quite silent and meditative all day, lay down at night beside the other two

It Is not long ago that, when a great
"gathering had assembled to hear the
inimitable Mark Twain lecture, they
found an empty platform before them
almost up to the very moment of start
ing. Then, just before the appointed
hour, there came on the boards a
rather simple-looking man who wan
dered aimlessly about, surveying first
the audience, then the empty stage,
then the roof, then the people again,
till they thought him demented. His
remarks were not less amusing.
"Very nice hall; very nice! Nice peo
ple; very nice people!" And so on.
Finally the _■ audience lost patience
and some called to him to "vanish"!
Then he came forward to the foot
lights and said in a most seriou3 voice:
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAUL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 19, 1897.
"Ladies and gentlemen, as I have to
lecture to you to-night, I think we will
now begin !"'
It was Mark himself, who had chosen
this amusing way for his introduction
to them. \_;j,^x ''*
Probably few introductions in Eng
land are of the style a famous traveler
experienced when lecturing in a back
woods town on his travels. The chair
man was a local desperado, who began
the proceedings in this style, evidently
thinking that his dignity in the chair
demanded supporting: *
"Gentlemen, this is Mr. , who is
going to tell us what he's seen; and If
any darned man contradicts or inter
feres he's got me to reckon with arter
it's all over."
And, in acknowledgment, he placed
a revolver on the table. The lecturer
was not contradicted or interfered
with.
The famous composer of "The
Mikado" tells a laughable story of how
he had once to apologize at a meeting
in the far West, where a great crowd
of people appeared on learning that
"Sullivan" would lecture on a certain
day. It was only when he had to con
front the audience that he discovered
they had come expecting to hear J. L.
Sullivan, the pugilist! The chairman
and his supporters, in introducing the
noted musician, had no small task in
calming the disappointed "far-west
ers.
ALASKA HAS BIG PRIZES
FOR THE WINNERS.
THE eyes of the gold hunters
of the world are on Alaska.
With the coming year will
begin one of the greatest
gold rushes in the history of
the world. It is safe to say
that fully 100,000 adventurers
will strain and struggle to
be first in the mad race for the new El
Dorado. Is there a chance for all?
Will not hundreds perish in the race?
Readers of those fascinating stories
of glittering finds made on the Klon
dike must not think for a moment that
any one can go there and pick up gold.
Far from it. The poor man who
reaches there with a dollar in his
pocket may, in the wild juggle of
things, strike on everlasting fortune,
but his chances are Infinitely smaller
than those of the capitalist who goes
there with sufficient means to permit
him to carefully comb over the pros
pects and select the offers of those com
pelled by necessity to sacrifice their
claims. The men who have made the
big strikes to date went into the' coun-

place of all; the most terrible road in the whole world, and in
the night one of the two remaining novelists vanished.

ly out of the country. Don't go to
Alaska unless you see your way clear
to getting out, and bear in mind that
in that rough, hard country you will
win no prizes in gold or trade without
a hard, stubborn struggle.
Alaska is no place for a weakling in
body or spirit. She has big prizes for
the winners, but to gain them one
must fight stoutly and steadfastly.
Read the story of Alaska and you
will find that only the stoutest hearted
and most persistent have ever won for
tunes from her. I wonder If the Impa
tient adventurers have any notion of
the extent of her vast domains. Her
mountains, moss plains, ice fields, for
ests and patches of flint, bushes, grass
and waterways cover about 600,000
square miles, an area about as large
as that part of the United States lying
east of the Mississippi River. She has
nearly three times as much coast line
as the rest of the United States. Sev
eral millions of men could lose them-

expanse practically nothing is known.
For instance, take Baranoff Island,
where Sitka, the capital, is situated.
It is eighty miles long by forty broad,
and has been settled for over 100 years.
Yet no one has ever penetrated the

Since Vitus Bering discovered the

nothing for 150 years. But plain furs
proved a giant bonanza for that big

After his death the company gradually
went to pieces and the fur trade lan
guished. In 1868 the Russian Govern

the United States for $7,000,000.'
Under the Americans the fish trade
was developed till it rivaled what was
left of the fur seal trade. More than
$6,000,000 is invested there now in sal
mon fisheries alone.
The golden period began in a modest
way about twenty years ago by the dis
covery of some placer mines near where
the city of Juneau now stands. Quartz
ledges were found later. The great
Tread well mine was developed and put
into successful operation. It produces
about $1,000,000 per annum, and has
a plant valued at $2,000,000. This suc
cess led to the discovery and develop-j
ment of other mining property
throughout the territory, until South
eastern Alaska produced about $3,000,

dike. First, gold was found on Stew
art river, a tributary of the Yukon,
and prospectors began to drift into that
region. New mines were discovered
slowly. What was then considered rich
diggings came to light, and Alaska
quietly and unostentatiously drifted
toward competency and civilization.
Last spring came the news of gold
discoveries that set the world agog.
And now expeditions are being form
ed in all parts of the world to venture
into this almost unknown region. So
much for the past development of the
country.
Alaska Is entering upon an era of
tremendous development and prosper
ity in comparison with the past. These
new conditions demand new regula
tions and new laws for her government.
Many new propositions will be present
ed to the coming Congress and many
of them will be wild and impracticable.
The best and safest proposition fox
the people of Alaska is to have Con
gress pass an act allowing the President
to appoint a commission of persons
who have resided in Alaska and who
are well acquainted with its needs and
conditions, to draft a code of laws,
both civil and criminal, and also to
make such changes in the organic act
and to establish such courts as may
be necessary.
From among the hardy, resourceful
men who sprinkle gold rushes there
will spring to the front brainy ones
plenty capable of handling all local
questions till the Government steps
in. Alaska is in need of such people.
They hustle around and force things
into line. Alaska has hibernated so
long that next spring's awakening
will be something tremendous for her.
The Indians have a saying: "White
man heap fool; take gun and go out
hunt bear. Indian take gun and go
out and wait for bear." In a rough
fashion that has been the character
of the country to date. Those Indians
are a queer lot to enterprising white
men. I remember a mine on Kotzebue
Sound; it is a very rich silver mine
and the farthest north in this country,
where the manager went to San
Francisco for the long winter, leaving
several natives to watch the plant and
the six tunnel mules till spring. When
Green got back In July he asked the
boss native what kind of a winter
they had had. "Oh, fine; heap fine,"
was the reply. "Heap plenty to eat.
Everything heap plenty and fat."
They had eaten the six mules. •
Alaska is probably the most Inacces
sible country on
the globe. To pros
pect the gold fields
requires not only
moral courage, but
a great deal of
physical strength
and endurance. All
its approaches are

To me it is a matter of regret that so
many people are determined to try to
get into this inhospitable country
during the coming spring and summer.
Thousands of them are going without
proper preparation and a sufficient
amount of means. There is no ques
tion but that many of them will meet
disappointment, suffering and death.
It will take years to properly (de
velop the broad Alaskan gold fields.l
I earnestly advise those who J<ft^e
planned to go and who have not ade- .
quate means for a year's camp there
to patiently wait until better and
cheaper facilities for reaching the
Yukon basin are supplied. Companies
have been formed to build railroad^
into the interior from different points
on the coast. Several of these com
panies will no doubt have a railway
constructed within the coming year.
There is no danger of the crop of
mines becoming exhausted within the
next twenty-five years. I came to the
California mines in 1852. I left in 1854
thinking the mines were worked out.
I returned here forty-two years after
ward and found that gold-mining in
California was only in its infancy;
more gold was produced this year than
will be produced in all Alaska and
British Columbia within the next two
years.
Once in the gold fields, what are the
chances for the poor man and the rich
man?
Briefly, then, without a proper outfit
and supplies, it is absolutely hopeless
for any one to tempt fortune by pros
pecting. The seasons are so shot"t. liv
ing so dear and traveling so difficult
that to work for wages practically cuts
a man ! off from aiming at anything
higher. With from $500 to $1000 ,in his
pocket,' however, a man may reason
ably try his chances with the best of
the prospectors. Consider some of the
difficulties of mining there and you will
see why this is so. As far as any one
has dug down the ground is solidly
frozen. One miner told me he had sunk
a shaft forty-five feet and the ground
was icebound ahead of him. Wood
cannot be got for less than $20 a cord.
The ground must be thawed with fire
before It can be picked out. WJ*uere
wages are $10 a day it costs about §_ J 0 __\
a foot to sink a hole. The poor 1 W*\\\m\\
can calculate how long he can hold P*-
to sink a shaft on his prospect a* (ditch
figures. But capital is going into the
country No doubt it . will give em
ployment to a large number of poor
men, both in working the older mines
I and in prospecting for new ones.
The gold field is very extensive. I be
lieve that good mires will be discov
ered north of the Yukon, and that b*-^*
fore many years ships will be trans- 1
porting miners and supplies through:,
Bering Strait into the Arctic Ocean
and landing them at the mouth of the
Coquille River for the purpose of work
ing the mines en that and other
streams which flow into the northern
ocean.
Outside of .finding employment in the
mines the poor man has practically no
chance of earning a living. There is
no country on earth where he can
starve to death quicker. The cold
temperature of almost eight months of
the year makes it imperative that he
'shall have a proper amount of food
and good clothing. True, the rush of
adventurers will develop lines of busi
ness that must furnish supplies to the
mines, but a limited number of men
will fill all such billets. The fish and
fur trades already have all the men
they can handle. The lumber business,
cuts but a small figure on acccount of
the scarcity of good timber. Agricul
ture and grazing will always be very
limited. Supplies will always have to
come from abroad, and only wealthy/
companies will be able to handle thejw j
in the present rough and expensive |
conditions of transportation. '*
One point these gold-rushers should I
bear In mind: In prospecting the prac
tical miner has very little or no advan
tage over the novice. In that country"
no person can figure on surface indi
cations while prospecting. Many of ;
the big finds of this last year were in
what you might call marshes. No
practical miner would have dreamed 1
of looking in such places for gold indi
cations. There is an old saying: "Silver,
lies in veins and gold is where you <>>*^
it." Six thousand years of experience-'
has proved the truth of this saying.
The chief \ advantage the practical
miner will have over the novice will be
in working and developing claims. : . J

able to supplement the best of the charts yet issued from his personal
familiarity with the field and from special sources.
This map is a long advance from the best maps hitherto obtain
able, and it will not be much improved upon until a long period of
exploration and survey has elapsed.

Ooxx* jailed and Draxvn for "The Call" "toy PROFESSOR GEORGE DAVIDSOX.
This map will be invaluable to those who invade the Yukon region
this year and next, and it will long be a valuable reference for all in
terested in Alaska.
The geographical features not charted it is impossible to chart.
The latest geographical information about the interior is here given,
but years of exploration and survey must elapse before this region is
mapped for any distance from the main watercourses. It includes in
its showing the magnetic variation of the compass, which it is neces
sary to know in finding directions by that instrument, as many travel
ers will have occasion to do. Lines of variation five degrees apart are
shown, and arrows indicate mere simply the direction in which the
needle actually points — to the magnetic pole and not the North Pole.
The overland route can be readily traced from Juneau to Dyea
by water, thence over Chilkoot Pass to Lake Lindeman and Lake
Bennett, where boats and rafts are built for the long journey of 600
miles down the watercourse to Dawson. The ride is on through Lake
Marsh, through or around White Horse Rapids and to the Lewis River,
thence to the Yukon, which is formed by the junction of the Lewis
and Pelly at Fort Selkirk. Chilkat Pass and White Pass may be
found on either side of Chilkoot Pass, and both may become important
routes. The proposed railroad is shown connecting the navigable
extremes of Stahkeen River and Feslin Lake in British territory.

        <text>Tanana, Alaska's New El Dorado: $100 in Gold to the Pan
M now being trumpeted'byTatiana, the
? ? Eldorado in Alaska.' Already thou?
sands of frenzied seekers after gold are there.
"For fortunes beyond the dreams of.ava
, rice are being garnered by placer mines along
the streams in that locality.
As much as $ioo a pan has.been washed
out in this new district. How startling these
figures are to miners may be judged from'the
fact that, ground averaging 40 cents to the
pan is considered a bonanza, and ip cents a
pan is regarded as big pay.
During the last winter, in spite of the
fact that the ground was frozen, one claim
averaged $1000 in pay dirt a day, and a num?
ber of claims changed hands at $60,000 each.
Within the last twelve months 4000
miners from the Klondike have rushed to the
new fields.* They were the first to hear the
news. All durW.g the winter hundreds strug?
gled thither over snow and ice. Indications
point to a remarkable rush northward from
Seattle this string.
Fairbanks, the centre of the Tatiana
region, consisted a year ago of a few log
cabins. To-day it is a prosperous city of over
three thousand people, with all the conven?
iences of modern city life.
AS SOON as boats are able to navigato the
inland streams of Alaska, a great summer
rush to Tanana is expected to begin. Re?
ports from Seattle state that gold-seekers
aro crowding therj from all parts of the country.
A surprisingly large number are outfitting as
though they had been in mining regions beforo nnd
knew how to arrange for the long and tiresomo trip
by steamer, dog team and afoot. , 1
' Freight charges from Seattle to Dawson in
eummer average over $7d a tori, and as much moro
from .Dawson to Fairbanks, so that the cost of tak?
ing along an extensive equipment is considerable.
It is estimated that the Tanana region pro?
duced $1,500,000 in gold last year, when tho num?
ber of miners was insignificant, compared with the
great army that will camp alonar its streams this
season.
Before news of tho rich'finds penetrated beyond
,the silent forests, pioneer prospeotorj had quietly
taken out a quarter of a million in yellow metal
flakes.
Until the new trails were broken aud in use,
Tanana was not an easy section of Alaska to reach
or leave, and travelers along that way wero scarce?
consisting principally of Indians hunting game or
stray prospectors nosing about for gold.
Situated on tho Tanana river, tho town of
Fairbanks is 150 miles southeast of tho point of
juncture pf that river with'the mighty Yukon; Daw
eon, in the Klondike, is 500 miles away to the oast
ward by sledgo trail, and to the south Valdez, on
the coast, is 5?i miles distant.
Discoverers of gold along tho Tanana wore not
inclined to shout tho glad tidings to the world.
Among those patiently .washing dift there dur?
ing the fall of 1002 wa*'a secretivo individual, a
Mexican, known as Pedro,
Pedro, like the others, lived in a little hut. His
bed was a blanket; chairs and table Avere simply
blocks of -wood. He had little use for the cabin, ex?
cept as a placo to sleep and store his provisions.
All the long arctic days ?ho searched soil along
the streams for gold, usually alone in the vast wil?
derness. At other places w? re other men'similarly
engaged, but they, too, were'there for business and
had little time for sociability. '
Ono day Pedro made" a big strike. Ho found
gold that turned out $100 to, the. pan. Pedro was
a rich man. Then he went away to the couth. But
he didn't spread the news-?he was faithful to tho
miners left behind. >
Others, too, were lucky. Stray prospectors
came that Avay andimmediately'located claims.- It
seemed as if somo had smelled the good news from
distant camps.,
For months this handful of men struggled
fiercely to wash all the gold they could before tho
mad rush they knew was coming, sooner or later.
First to arrivo Avere some steamboat men Avho
had ascended the river with supplies for tho trading,
post just opened at Fairbanks. These men heard
of the marvelous new field and promptly staked
claims there.
Among them was an energetic Japanese named
Wada, Avho, like others of his race, had been in
many mining camps of the far North.
For some reason, as soon as ho had ctaked his
claim and learned of the richness of the region,
Wada started out on a long, lono tramp over the
snow, with a dog team drawing his ? ipplies, for
Dawson) BOO mi lea away.
No trail liad been broken -or at least half the
distanco, butWada. plunged along, helping the dogs
and Making from fifteen to twenty-five inilos a day.
He wns tho first to bear the news of Tanana'a
wealth to Bawsou, and minors of the older Klondike
region immediately Avent wild.
This was in the Avintor of.lOO'i?an exception?
ally cold season, even in Alaska.
Without waiting for spring, -.rimers hurried off
in hundreds for a 6U0-mile journey over snow and
ice, and through a.roadless -yilderness, in a tem?
perature from 50 to CO degreed below ?ero.
Hastily authoring what supplies thoy could,
some left Bawson in small sleighs drawn by horses,
others with ?log teams; but the greater number
hurried along on foot, drawing their sleda them-,
? 'selves. '. ? ?
'?, It was a mad rush for g?ld^:3ir?ny.reached tha
?new field before spring, ?but hundreds of others
came'toiling in all during tho sunom?f. '.,.'
, "When the majority arrived thoy, found the best
claims'already taken, a shortago of, supplies facing
them, and discouragement in tho air.
Wada had returned with the rush. When some
of the men realized their position, they brga?niged'
a miners' meeting and decided to hang the' Jap.
A rope Avas found, and Wada was about to be
strung tip, when ho produced a copy ?f a Seattle
newspaper, showing that he had onco saved the
lives of many whalers, ico-impriaoned in the Arctic
Ocean by tramping overland from Point Barrow to,
St. Michael in dead of winter.
This saved his life, but "Wada Avas driven from
the region to which he had invited tho rush.
In spite of their first disappointment, tho new?
comers spread out and set to work. At this time
gold was only known to exist along one creek. Soon
it" was found along a dozen creek's.
In the spring tho rush from Bawson continued
by steamboat. Olairas were located in overy direc?
tion. Now hundreds who arrived late, or Avho found
that thoir claims did not pay, ar.o working as labor?
ers for tho moro fortunate.
In a little Avhilo, too, all thb surface gold had
been panned, so that it became noces?ary to work
the underground strata by machinery.
; When'tha Klondike Avaa struck, the only method .
known of thawing the frozen ground for sinking
ehafta and running tunnela was to build Avood fires
on the surface, scrapo away the earth as far as it
had thawed, build other fires and keep this tedious
process up indefinitely.
Already at Tnnana steam thawers aro being
used, and steam"ia also employed to movo the wind?
lass buckets that lift the earth.
Theeo steam engines and boilers aro brought
from the etistern United States at great expense.
It is estimated that there ore now about one hun?
dred and fifty at work in the Tnnana region, and
many more are expocted this1 spring.
Iron pipes with hojes in ono end inject the
steam into tho frozen ground. An enormouaamount
of-fuel is required to feed theso boilora, and it.is
estimated that fully one-fifth tho laborers in tha
Tannini country are engaged in cutting and hauling
wood.
This wood costs from $7 to .$10 a cord, and as
each camp burns thousands .of cords a winter, it ia
fast becoming scarce.
Hydraulic methods of mining will bo employed
this Bummer, when the soft surf ace way bo swept
away very offec'ually. Machinery for this work is
also expensive, and freight rates to the interior aro
enormous.
The best-paying claims so far located nro on
Fairbanks, Cleary, Gold Stream and Pudro creel?.
Scattered all along theso etreama and their
numerous tributaries are tho hottics of tho miners.

San Diego, Cal., July 19. An Interesting
letter telling of the recent trip of the
steamer Excelsior to Alaska has been writ
ten by Captain J. F. Hlggins, of the steam
er, to a friend In this city Hesajs.
"The word Klondike means Deer river,
which Is called Reindeer river on the
charts. It empties into tho Yukon fifty
miles abovo tho big river. The geographic
al position of the Junction is 76 degrees 10
minutes north latitude. 139 degrees 50 min
utes west longitude. Ronanza creek dumps
Into Klondike about two miles above the
Yukon. Eldorado is a tributary of the
Bonanza. Ther are numerous other creeks
and tributaries, the main river being 300
miles long The gold so far has been taken
from the Ronanza and Eldorado, both well
named, for the richness of the placers lz
truly marvelous. Eldorado, thirty miles
long. Is staked the whole length and as far
as worked has paid.
"As each claim Is 509 feet along the creek
bed, there is half a million to the claim.
So uniform has the output been that one
miner who has an Interest In three claims
told me that If offered his choice he would
toss up to decide. One of our passengers
who Is taking J1.000 with him has worked
100 feet of his ground and refused J200,0u0
for the remainder and confidently expects
to clean up J100.0O) nnd more. He has In a
bottle J212 from one pan of dirt. His pay
dirt while btlng washed averaged J250 an
hour to each man shoveling In Two others
of the miners who worked their own claims
cleaned up J6O0O from tho day's washing.
"There Is about fifteen feet of dirt above
DedrccK, the pay streak averaging from
four to six feet, which Is tunneled out while
the ground Is frozen Of course the ground
tal.cn out is thawed by building fires, and
when the thaw comes and water rushes In
they set their sluices and wash the dirt.
Two of our fellows thought a small bird

and sold their claims for Jlj.OuO, getting
JI.500 down, tho remainder to be paid In
monthly installments of J10000 each The
purchasers had no more than J3.000 paid.

nature of a confidence game appears to
have been worked on the North American
Trading and Transportation Company, or
its officials In charge of the Portland, by
the miners. Each man was required to
place his gold dust in the ship's safe, but
this was not done, by any meant Many
of tho miners secreted their dust In

        <text>Inexhaustible Riches of the Northern El Dorado
        The business equilibrium of Seattle was never so
disturbed as it has been by the news of the
richness of the recent Klondyke strikes.
'For forty-eight hours the telegraph offices
of this city have been thronged by people
sending messages to Eastern friends
making a request for sufficient money to
get into the new camp. The list of those
who have arranged to go includes not only
'clerks and such as work for salary, but
business and professional men of recog
nized standing and ability.
"Send me $500. Stake me enough
money to go to Klondyke. News not in
the least exaggerated," is the tenor of the
appeal flashed over the wires. Men are
t being grubstaked in tnis city to an extent
never before thought of and never before
possible. Some local bouses who are
likely to lose trustworthy and well-known
. employes will be behind them in many
cases, while individual men with money
at their disposal who by reason of circum
stances cannot go are not slow to outfit
men in whom they can place unbounded
; confidence.
-*" Many amusing instances connected with
grubstakes are transpiring.- One which
will actually describe the situation had
its finale this morning early. A well
known man, honest but poor, was one of
the first stricken with the desire to go.
• The information reached a friend Satur
. day afternoon and shortly • after the two
met. "How much do you want?" in
> quired No. 2 of the Klondyke fever pa
tient. "I think about $400," was the re
[ spon-e. "bee me in the morning; I think
I can stake you." Sunday the two did
not meet, but early this morning they
did,, when No. 2 gave the first man a chill
that extended down the vertebra^ to the
end of his toes. "I guess that matter is j
all off," No. 2 said. "I have about decided
to go myself, and my man who is inter- 1
ested with me is also going."
It must be said that meanwhile noth- !
ing is occurring which in the least de- :
j tracts or discredits tho Monte Cristo-like
tales first sent out from the district. Sub- j
sequent reports not only verify but tend to
enlarge upon the first accounts. Hon.
C. H. Macintosh, Governor of the North
west Territory, comprising the districts of
j Alberta, Saskatchewan, Assinniboia and
the unorganized districts of the Yukon, i
Athabasca and all the territory east to ;
Labrador and Hudson Bay, arrived in j
Seattle' to-day, being en route to Regina,
the capital of tha Territory. He was seen
at the Rainier CluD.of which he is a guest,
this afternoon. When asked for an ex
pression of his views regarding the great
Klondyke district Governor Macintosh
, replied:
"We are only on the threshold of the
greatest discovery 'ever made. Gold has
been piling up in all -these innumerable
streams for hundreds of years. Much of ]
the territory the, foot of man has .never ,
trod. It would hardly be possible for one '
jySS exaggerate tee richness, hot only of the ,
Klondyke, but other districts in the Cana- ;
dian«"Yukon. At the same time the folly |
of thousands rushing in there without I
proper means of subsistence and in utter !
ignorance of the geographical conditions j
1 of the country should be kept ever in '
• mind. There are fully 9000 miles of these
i golden waterways in this section of the ;
', Yukon. Rivers, creeks and streams of i
l every size and description are all pos- I
"sessed of more or less gold. I derived this j
knowledge from many old Hudson Bay
\ explorers, who assured me that they con
sidered the gold-bearing district next to
_ inexhaustible.
"In 1894 I made a report to Sir John
Thompson, then Premier of Canada, and
• who died the same year at Windsor
Castle, strongly urging that the name
Yukon should be given to that country
by order in council and that a body of !
;. Canadian police be established on the ;
river to maintain order. This was done j
j in 1&05 and the British outpost of Fort '<
; Cudahy was founded. I have known gold |
>. to exist there since 1889 consequent upon !
a report made me by W. Ogilvie, the j
Government explorer.
Many of "-/hat will no doubt prove to be
as rich or richer streams than the Klon- i
dyke have not been explored or pros- I
pected. Among these I might mention
Dominion Creek, Hootalinqua River, ',
: Stewart River, Liard River and a score of j
~ other streams comparatively unknown. j
It is my judgment and opinion that the
1897 yield of the Canadian Yukon will ex- i
ceed $10,000,000 in gold. Of course as is |
the case of the Cariboo and Cassiar dis- I
tricts years ago, it will be impossible to
accurately estimate the full amount taken
. out. There is now far in excess of $1,000,
--000 remaining already mined on the Klon
dyke. It is in valises and tin cans and
some of it is lying loose in saloons and
just as sacredly guarded there and appa
. rently as safe as though it was in vaults.
"Already this spring we have official
knowledge of, over $2,000,000 in gold ;
having been taken out of the Klondyke j

camps. It was shipped out, as you know, j
on the steamers Excelsior ana Portland. .
Let me cite a little incident or an instance t
shewing the gold yield of some of the j
Klondyke claims. A friend of mine went j
to a dump and was looking it over, and lie j
told me that it bore the appearance of |
some ones having taken and poured j
bucketfuls of gold nuggets down over the
dump. In truth, he said there appeared ;
to be more gold than dust. Incidentally*
I may say to you that we have data of an j
official nature which leads us to believe i
ttiat the gold output for the Rossland and !
Kootenay districts for 1397 will be in excess j
of $7,000,000, including the silver yield I j
should have said, and I have no hesitancy j
in asserting that within the course of five I
years the gold yield of the three districts j
named will exceed that of either Colorado, |
California or South Africa."
Governor Macintosh announced that I
the Government is seriously considering i
the construction of a railroad into the I
Yukon district. In fact, he said, it has \
several corns of engineers now making ;
surveys.
"One route," the Governor said, "con- i
templates the operation of a line of steam
ers from Fort Wrangel up the Stickeem
R ver, which Is open to both countries,
under the Washington treaty of some
twenty-five years ago, to Telegraph Creek.
From Telegraph Creek surveyors are now
endeavoring to ascertain the feasibility of :
the construction of a railway line from j
125 to 130 miles to Teslin Lake. The route
extends through scrubby timber, and has }
only one or two serious obstacles. Begin- '
ning with Teslin Lake, boats will be oper- j
ated along a series of lakes and rivers that j
connect with the Stewart and Pelly rivers :
emptying into the Yukon. It is claimed ;
that no serious difficulties, that is diffi- !
culties such as cannot be reasonably over- j
come, are encountered anywhere along
this route.
"1 may say in this connection that tbe
route I have just described to you would
be more than 3000 miles shorter than the
present route by way of Sl Michaels and
the YuKon and every foot of it would be
in British territory. There is another
route through Canada which has been
found possible. A railway extends from j
Calgary, Northwest Territory, over 200 |
miles. Then there is a trail, and a good j
one, from Edmonton to Athabasca, land
ing in the unorganized district of Atha- j
basca.* Hudson Bay ' boats how run over
.Athabasca La k.* down slit river of Atha- j
basca to the vicinity of McKenzie River,
where it has' been found possible with
very easy portages to reach the Porcupine
River, and thence down that stream into
the' Yukon. The Government explorer, j
Mr. Ogilvie, made an inspection of this
route several times, once in 1887. once in
1888 and in 1890 and 1891 with Mr. j
Dawson, the director-general of geological j
surveys. The White horse River route is J
also considered feasible."
The Governor leaves in the morning for I
Victoria, going thence to his capital. Re- j
gina. He comes here in reality to see one j
of his sons, who has the fever, safely off
to the Klondyke.
Discussing the Stikeem River route the j
Alaska Mining Record of Juneau in the | i
issue of July 14 says:

' Joseph A. Costello, a well-known news
paper man, has resigned his position with
the Seattle Times and will leave Sunday
for. the Klondyke, accompanied by Mr.
Branson and Samuel Archer, also of the
same paper.
The late Alaska papers announce that
Robert Insley, proprietor of the Juneau
Opera-house, recently married Miss
Blanche Lamont, a San Francisco vaude
ville performer, and that the people pro
ceeded at once on a wed iing tour involv
ing a trip to the Klondyke.
While the Alaskan placers are all the
talk, Captain Mem of the London Ex
ploration Company would have it under
stood that there is also a little quartz
around Juneau, and he is quoted by a
paper of that town as saying: "There are
7,000.000 tons of ore in sight at; the Paris
or Treadwell mine on Douglass Island."
This would run a 500-stamp mill for
eleven years." ' V ■■
PORTLAND'S OPPORTUNITY.
Oregon's Metropolis May Supply
the 50.000 Who Will Rush to
the North.
PORTLAND, Or., July 19.— Hon. J. B.
Montgomery, the millionaire land-owner,
to-day handed The Call correspondent
the appended excerpt from a letter. from
his son Russeil on the Klondyke district:
"Here is the golden opportunity for
Portland. Our city is staid, steady and a
little slow, but we. get there all the same.
I have no doubt at all that 50,000 men will
rush into Alaska in the next twelve
months. It will not be alone from Ore
gon, California and Washington, but from
every State 1 in the Union. Remember the
rush to California in 1850. Why, this will
beat it out of sight. The argonauts bad
to sail around the horn and across the
plains. It took six months. Now they
can cross the continent, in, less v than a
week and for a quarter of the sum. The
gold placers of the Yukon appear to be
tenfold richer than those on the American
River. r --"V*!>V '
"I have been examining a United States
Circle Giy at Midn'ght on June 20.
Government map. It shows a range of
mountains from 4000 to 19,000 feet high.
Out of these run the Pelly, Klondyke and
other rivers. All of them will no doubt
furnish rich placer diggings. And then
think of the illimitable auriferous rock in
these mountains. California has fur
nished $1,000,000,000 of gold— more than
half from her quartz and to-day, after
fifty years of delving and mining, she
produces mote gold than any other region
in the world. Where will these 50,000
Alaska argonauts be supplied from? Un
doubtedly Portland ought to do it, and
she will. We are very deliberate, as I
said, but we get there. What will they
require? Well, at least 100,000 barrels of
flour and an equal weight ot meats and
groceries. We have the transportation here
to do it with. The Oregon Railway and
Navigation Company has lour steamers in
the San Francisco trade. They have been
running with a -beggarly array of empty
berths until the recent reduction to carry-'
ing people for next to nothing. They
could put two of them on and put on tbe
Yukon their river steamers, which I am
told have been doing charity work for ten
years."
GOING FROM BERKELEY.
Party of Ton Men Being Organized
at the Co less Town for
Klondyke.
BERKELEY, Cal.. July 19.— party of
ten men is being organized in the uni
versity town to go into the Klondyke
gold fields..
Hansford .Griffith, a graduate of the
University of Virginia and at present a
student at Berkeley, is at the head of the
scheme. xMuuu -VVuV"----. ."■-.■
He proposes that each of the party of
ten put up $500 to defray the expense of
reaching the gold fields and purchasing a
year's provisions and outfitting. They
will go by way of Juneau and will leave
as soon as the ■ party is complete and
transportation can be secured. :>
■ It is proposed that the party remain in
Alaska for at least two years. Those who
are strongly considering the ; proposition
made by Griffith are J. C. Berry of 'the
tailoring firm of " Mikkelsen_*' Berry,
Charles Graham and A.B. QuacKenbush ,
all of whom are well known in business.
All of those mentioned are . young men
and are accustomed to ' roughing ' it. Two
of them will leave wives and families.

TACOMA, Wash., July : 19.— Gold has
been found on Section 36, between Gig
Harbor and Henderson Bay. George
Barnaby struck a handful of small nuggets
on Saturday afternoon while working on
the road, and a dozen placer claims have
been staked out. The school section is a
mile from Gig Harbor and two miles from
Purdy on the Gig Harbor and Springfield
road. Several Tacoma and Gig Harbor
men who are investigating believe there is
paying geld on the section, and will com
mence sluicing at once. The find has
diverted some of the excitement over the
Klondyke. Others claim it is an attempt
to secure valuable school lands through
the medium of mineral filings.

NEW YORK, N. V., July 19.— H. W.

invest $1000 each in a company to go to
Klondyke. Afterward he explained his
idea was: "To get 'five or six young
fellows to form themselves into an in

there by, way of Seattle, Sitka Island and
St. Michaels and lip the Yukon and
straight up to Klonkyke. There each

RICHEST IN THE WORLD.
Six Miners From the Klondyke Tell
of the Wonderful Finds of
Gold Already Made. .
' A party of six miners direct from the
Klondyke reached here yesterday at noon,
having come down by rail from Seattle.
They are C. E. Myers, B. F. Purcell, J.
O. Clements, Charles Leonard, C. Bran-
nan and J. J. Halterman. The stories
they -tell of the fabulous wealth of the dis
trict they have recently left bear out the
reports which have been coming in for the
past week. They are of the party which
came down on the steamer Portland and
are the advance guard of twenty- or
thirty of their comrades who are expected
to-day.
Myers, who seems to be the leader of the
party, is a practical miner of long experi
ence, and says he left Preseott, Ariz., in
the spring of 1896, and has bepn woreing
claim 30 on El Dorado Creek, owned by
McDonald & Chappie, for half tho profits.
They started in late in the spring, after
nearly every one had quit work, and were
laughed at by the miners for so doing.
The V day after- commencing work they
struck bedrock, and in the next thirty
three days took out $41,000. i.v *,:
• Mr. Myers says he believes ho took from
this claim the biggest pan ever washed in
the district. From i a shovel half full of
dirt he got $800. As illustrating the value
of the claim and the richness of the dirt
he also says that his partner, and himself
in six hours' shoveling "cleaned up" three
times, and in each ."clean up" got $8000.
Myers owns claim 51 above Discovery, on
Bonanza Creek, which be intends to work
next season. ,
Another member of , the . party, J. 0.
Clements, is said to have disposed of a
claim for $50,000, and has in the , safe of
the Golden West Hotel a nugget valued at
$231. The nugget seems to be about half
pure gold, and is a very rich specimen. .-;
Charles Leonard has been three years in
Aiaskn, one of which has been spent in
the Klondyke country. In three and a
half months' actual work he says he took
Yukon Steamer Bella as She Appeared While Gearing in -the Spring From C City.
out $14,000. He is going back in the
spring, and seems to be very well satisfied
with the result of bis work.
B. F. Purcell is a man about sixty years
of age and left his home near St. Louis in
April, 189G, bound for the Yukon. He did
not reach the Kionnyke. however, until
thelst of January, 1897, and while he de
clines to state the amount of gold he has
brought out with him, says that he sold a
half interest in claim No. 28 above Dis-
covery on Bonanza Creek for $21,000, not
including the dirt already on the dump*
and says that he is very well satisfied. As
be expresses it the El Dorado and Bo- |
nanza Creek districts are a golden
wonder, but he is ot the opinion that the
Stewart River country which is about
eighty miles above Dawson and which
was being explored as he came out, will
be found to exceed in richness anything
yet discovered. He says there is room for
200.000 men in the mining districts of I
Alaska without any crowding, but that
the suffering this winter will be terrible
and characterizes any attempt to reach
there this fall as foolhardy.
Myers says, the pay dirt on the claim he
has been working is more than 150 feet
wide and at least a foot in depth and tbat
he has never taken out a pan which gave
less than $1. On claim 27 in the same dis
trict he says there was a streak eight feet
wide and five feet deep which went from
$17 to $82 a pan. That claim sold for
$50,000, and $:00,000 would not buy it to
day. It is owned by "Big" Alex McDon
ald and James Dough try. He tells of a
man named Andrew Nelson who made
$40,000 for a partner who had given him a
grab stake and had never seen the claim.
The largest amount brought down by any
one member of the party is placed at
between $70,000 and $80,000. Myers built
the third house erected at Dawson City,
and says the discovery of gold in '49 is a
mere bagatelle compared to that of the
Alaska placers.
* The men tell harrowing tales of their
sufferings and say that, the hardships
which must be endured in order to exist
cannot be exaggerated. Several of the
party have not yet recovered from the
.scurvy, and ail appear to be physically
demoralized. : Their lust for gold, how
ever, is not dimmed, and they are anxious
to resume the search for hidden treasure. !
While wages are very high, said-one of the '
party, : a man had much better work a ,
claim on shares, for h'.» he's got to make » \
groat (deal jof money to .'repay him for '
going to such a country. " Last winter was !
a mild one. the thermometer only ' reach
ing about 70 degrees below zero. During
a severe season it frequently goes' away
down in the eighties.
Referring to the amount of dust brought
down on the Portland, they say it is im- j
possible to make a correct estimate of the
total, value, as. nearly every man. secreted
all he could- in his personal effects and |
clothing. Said one: "It would not sur
prise me to know that two- million dol- [
lars' worth of dust and nuggets came into
Seattle on thessteamer. ;'.'--.■
With one or two exceptions the men in
tend remaining in San Francisco until
ready to start on their northern journey.
Going to the mines the men say the route i
over the "divide" should always be taken, }
and in coming out the river route is
preferable. One of the men claims to
have lost a satchel in which he had over j
$1000 worth of , walrus ivory, and each of
the men has brought down some of the j
stuff. ; One beautiful specimen of walrus
tusk was shown for which the owner said j
he paid $5, and which must be worth at
least $50 or $60. . , .
A member of the party tells of the ex
perience of a man who located the claim
adjoining his. This man had been in the
Alaska mines for more than five years
and had been unable to make a "strike."
At last, becoming disgusted with his luck,
lie resolved to leave the country. On the
day before he was to leave Circle City
word reached that place of the Klondyke
discovery. He decided to try his luck
once more ana immediately started for
the new diggings. In three months he
had taken out more than $20,0u0 and is
still pegging away, resolved to stay until
be has $500,000. A man should' not, how
ever, ■ say these gold-seekers from the
north, remain in the country 'more than
one season without coming to the world of
civilization. By coming out he acquires a
new lease of life, as it were, and goes back
better qualified' to cope with the hard
ships to which he must submit.
"Oar greatest privation," said Mr. Par
cell, "is the scarcity of fresh meat. A
small band of cattle* was driven in last
fall, and if it had not been for these' I
think a great many of us would have
died. Any kind of beef brings 50 cents a
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
pound, and at times it. is impossible to
get it at any price. At an eating-house
(it could hardly be dignified by the name
of restaurant) two fried' eggs generally
cost $5, and a square meal would cost
more than a day's wages."
Charles Brannan owns claim 38 on
Bonanza Creek, said to be one of the best
paying properties in that particular dis
trict. The patriarch of the party, B. F.
Purcell, who is also one of the most en
thusiastic, says that there is hardly a foot
of ground in either the El Dorado or
Bonanza Creek districts which does not
carry gold in paying quantities, and that
for 300 miles which has been prospected it
is the richest country in the world. "]
do not believe it would be possible to ex
aggerate the wealth to be found there."
said he, "and the future will add to
rather than detract from the marveloui
stories already brought from there."
AN "OFFICIAL" REPORT.
Dominion Surveyor Ogilvie Haa
Sent an Account of the Dis
coveries to Ottawa.
"Official" information about the Yukon
diggings is scare, and valuable.. The off
hand stories of lucky prospectors have
made up most of the tale to date. A Gov
ernment report of the Klondyke digging!
was published but a short time ago, and it
will be read with faith in its reliability.
It is by Surveyor William O.ilvie, located
at Klondyke, for the Canadian Govern
ment, and it was given out by the Gov
ernment at Ottawa. From this report the
following extracts are taken:
The name "Klondyke" is a mispronuncia
tion of the Indian word or words Thron-dak
or Duick, which means pletny of fish, irom
the fact that it is a famous salmon stream, li
is marked Tondack on our map! It joins the
Yukon from the east a few miles above the
site of Fort Reliance, about fifty miles above
Forty Mile. As I hsve already Intimated, thai
rich placer mines of gold were discovered in th«
branches of this stream, 1 believe, was due to
the reports of Indians. A white man named
G. W. Carmach, who worked with me in 1837,
was the first to take advantage of the rumors
and locate a claim oh the first branch, which
was named by the miners Bonanza Creek.
Carmach located here late In August,
but had to cut some logs for the mill
nere to get a tew pounds of provisions to
enable him to begin worK on his claim, the
fishing at Klondyke having totally failed him.
He returned with a few weeks' provisions for
himself, his wife and brother-iD-law (Indians)
and another Indian in the last days of August
and immediately set about working bis claim.
As he was very short of appliances he could
only put together a rather defective appira
tus to wash the gravel with. The gravel itself
he had to carry in a box on his back from 30
to 100 feet.
Nowithstanding this the three men, work
ing very irregularly.^ washed out $1200 in
eight days, and Carmacb asserts with reason
that had he , proper facilities it Could hive
been done in two' days, besides having several
hundred dollars mete gold, which was lost on
the tailings through defective apparatus.
.When it was fairly established that Bonanza
Creek* was rich in gold,' which took a few
days, for Klondyke had been prospected sev
eral times with no encouraging results, there
was a great rush from all over the country
adjacent to Forty Mile. The town was almost
deserted; men who had been in a chronic
stated drunkenness for weeks were pitched
into boats as ballast and taken up to stake
themselves a claim, and claim were stake l by
men for their friends who were not in the
country at the time. All this gave rise to
much confliction ana confusion, there being
no one to take charge of matters. The agent
being unable to go up and attend to the
thing, and myself not knowing what todo, the
miners held a meeting and appointed one o|
themselves to measure off and stake the
claims and record the owners' names, for
which he got a fee of $2, it being of course
understood that each claim-holder would
have to record his claim with the Dominioq
agent and pay his fee of $15.
I am afraid a state of affairs will develop in
the Klondyke district that will worry some
one. Naturally many squabbles will arise out
of those transactions. Many of the claims are
said tb be only 300 and 400 feet long, and ol
course the holders will insist on getting them
the full 500, ana it is now probably impossi
ble that they can without upsetting ail the
claim-holders on the several creeks.
So encouraging were the reports irom the
Klondyse regions that all the creeks around
are practically abandoned, especially those on
the head of Forty-mile, in American territory.
Miller ana Glacier creeks, on the head ol
Forty-mile River, which my survey of the
141 st meridian determined to be in. Canada,
were thought to be very rich, but they are
poor both in quality and quantity compared
with Klondyke. '
The extent of the gold-bearing section here
is such as to warrant the assertion that we
have here a -district which will give 1000
claims of 500 feet in length each. Now 1000
such claims will require at least 3000 men to
work them properly, and as wages for working
in the mines are from $8 to $10 per day, with
out board, we have every reason to assume
that this part of our territory will within a
year or two contain 10,000 souls at least, for
the news has gone out to the coast and an un
precedented influx is expected next spring.
And this is not all. for a large creek called
Indian Creek joins the Yukon about midway
between Klondyke and Stewart River, and all
along this creek'good pay has been found. All
that has stood in the way of j working it here
tofore has been -the scarcity of .provisions and
the difficulty ot getting them up there even
when here. Indian Creek is quite a largo
stream, and it is probable it will yield 500 or
600 claims.

JUNEAT', Alaska. April 4 (by steam-
Bhip Al-Ki, via Seattle, April B).— A
horrible catastrophe, surpassing in the
number of fatalities the flooding of the
canyon last fall by the mountain lake,
nas occurred in Dyea Canyon, between
Sheep Camp and the Scales. An ava
lanche of snow and ice yesterday after
aoon swooped down the mountain,
burying alive and crushing between
forty and fifty men, and injuring nearly
is many more. There is great excite
ment as Skaguay and Dyea, and many
will leave here for the scene of the dis
ister on the steamship Australia, which
sails late f>-night for Skaguay. The
srst news of the calamity reached here
at 5 o'clock this afternoon on th»
Bteamship Discovery and the Al-Ki
came in at about 8 o'clock to-night and
;onfirmed the report.
The Al-Ki left Skaguay at 9:30 this
morning. As the fatal snow slide oc
curred at about 4 o'clock yesterday
(Sunday) afternoon only meager details
were obtainable here to-night. The
representative of The Cah whom I left
In charge at Skaguay and Dyea during
my absence chartered a tug at Skag
uay last evening to take him around
the point to Dyea and from there he
will go by horse to the place of death.
I will reach the scene to-morrow after
noon.
A telephone message was received at
Skaguay from Dyea late last night,
stating that twenty-seven bodies had
been dug out of the snow. A large force
of volunteers is at work with pick and
shovel throwing aside the snow in the
hope that it may be in time to rescue
Borne of the buried men alive. The res
cuers worked all night.
About 8 o'clock this morning another
message came by telephone from Dyea
stating that eighteen more bodies
had been excavated. If these figures
are accurate they will make a total of
forty-three dead.
The slide occurred in about the same
place where the lake of water broke
loose last fall. It was near Stone
House and over on the other side of the
canyon. John Pellett of Seattle, a pas
senger on the Discovery, left Sheep
Camp yesterday morning, a few hours
before the snow slide. He said:
"The first we heard of the accident
was last evening at Skaguay. The re
port came over from Dyea by tele
phone. I left Sheep Camp early yes
terday morning to catch the first boat
south. It had been snowing steadily
for two days up the canyon. It was a
heavy, wet snow. Great quantities of
It accumulated on the mountain sides,
and I expected some of it to fall down.
There was so much snow that I did not
Bee how it could cling to the sides of the
canyon. Great fields and mountains of
It were piled upon the top of the can
yon on both sides. There are tents and
camps all along the canyon. The men
gx» up loaded early in the morning and
come back to their camp or cache at
Sheep Camp at 11 or 12 o'clock. In the
afternoon they make another trip to
the summit or the Scales, and along
about 4 o'clock and on to 5 o'clock there
j- «». r*Kular crocession of men cominir
bark on the trail. That explains to me
why so many were caught and buried.
"The walls of the canyon opposite
Stone House are almost perpendicular.
A man would have only one chance In
a hundred of petting out of the way
of an avalanche there, even If he
looked up and saw It earning. It would
be a straight fall Instead of a slide. I
heard that thirty-one dead men were
taken out last night."
A little more light Is thrown on the
disaster by the situation of the trails
at Stone House. The horse trail runs
to the right of the canyon, going up
and over close to Stone House. Foot
and handsled trail Is over on th~ op
posite side and follows the course of
the river, which is considerably lower
than the horse trail, and all day Ions?
there are twenty men on the hand
sled trail to one on the horse trail. I
have seen 100 men on this trail within
a distance of fifty yards, going and
coming. Nearly opposite Stone House,
on the brow of the canyon, is a glacier.
Its walls of ice, beautiful as emerald
and sapphire in' the sunshine, an im
aginary cathedral of the skies, stand
exposed in June as well as in January-
It does not melt away the y?ar round.
Mountains of snow crown this glacier
during the winter. This is the point
from which the avalanche came.
A small snow slide which occurred
shortly before the big avalanche buried
two or three men who were encampc-d
along the trail. While those on the trail
were hard at work endeavoring to ex
tricate the unfortunates the monster
avalanche swept down the mountain
side, crushing the tents pitched along
the trail and enveloping scores of men,
the majority of whom were endeavoring
to assist those who had met with mis
fortune in the previous smaller slide.
The injured gold-seekers who have
been rescued are terribly lacerated, and
it is feared that a number of them will
die. As soon as the news of the calam
ity was made known along the trail
men hurried to the scene from Dyea
and other points, and with shovels,
picks and even pans and pails toiled
to extricate the unfortunates. Sheep
Camp was soon left without an inhabi
tant, as every one from there to the
scales was soon on the scene.
The sight was an awful one, for there
in a state of terrible excitement, which
increased as the bodies were uncovered,
were brothers, fathers, sons and friends
anxiously digging, trembling lest the
next body they uncovered should. be
that of a loved one. As in the rush to
the " gold fields, but few men, even
though traveling together, went to the
trouble of inquiring as to the names
of their companions, the greater num
ber of the dead have not been Identi
fied, and those who have been taken
out alive are so benumbed and dazed
that they can hardly tell who had been
in company with them.
The roar of the avalanche could be
distinctly heard at Sheep Camp and as
far as Canyon City, situated about six
miles south of the fatal spot.
Seventeen men. all members of the
Chilkoot Transportation Company,
started over the trail on Sunday morn
ing and had about time to reach the
Scales when the terrible slide occurred.
None of them have since been seen,
and none of their bodies have been re
covered. It Is feared the entire party
was caught in the slide and killed.
There were a good many tents covered
up beyond the reach of rescuers and
numbers of bodies will never be re
covered until the spring sun thaws
away their snow graves.
At the Stone House four big slides
occurred. One hundred men, who were
descending by the aid of a life line 200
yards long, were caught. Of these only
three are known to have been saved.
At the Scales, where the third slide
took place, at least 100 tons of outfits
were covered up. S. A. Townsend of
Fort "Worth, Texas, talking of the cal
amity, says:
"From personal knowledge and in
quiry it is my judgment that at least
150 people were killed by the slides.
When I left Sheep Camp at 10:30 a, m.
on Monday morning thirty-one dead
bodies had been recovered, and the
number of injured that hed been res
cued was reported at twenty-five."
The dead are being laid out in a tent
used as a bunkhouse. Nobody is per
mitted to touch the remains. Many
physicians have gone to the scene from
Dyea, and there are about a half dozen
doctors at Sheep Camp also; so there
is no lack of medical attendance for
the injured. There is a well conducted
tent hospital at Dyea. The law au
thorizes the United States Commission
er at Dyea to act as Governor.
A report that the bodies had been
robbed lacks confirmation. The United
States troops at Dyea would probably
interfere to prevent any desecration of
that kind.
The report that forty-three men had
been killed was corroborated by Purser
Bush of the Al-Ki. One of the men who
brought down the first news of the
avalanche on the steamship Discovery
was Oeorge Bach, who came from
Seward City in February. with the first
information of the loss of the Clara Ne
vada, and who is the only person who
saw her burn. The work of recovering
i the dead from the snow continues.

ST. MICHAELS, Alaska, Sopt. 15.—
The most remarkable gold mining at
present In the world, if not in the entire
history of gold mining, is that now in
progress at and about Cape Nome, on
Norton Sound, Behring Sea, Alaska, sit
uated about 225 miles north and west
of the mouth of the Yukon river, or 135
miles from this point. Gold was first dis
covered on Snake river last fail, and
during the earlier portion of this season.
Cape Nome district had acquired con
siderable repute as a gold producer, and
not a few miners from the Yukon river

/ country, many of them stranded here,
f went over to Nome and either staked
such claims as they could get, or secured
work as they could find It. Much com
plaint was made that claims had been
taken by persons holding powers of at
torney, their principals not being present
in person, and in June the Cape Nome
district had become so unpopular 'hat
reports were circulating to the effect that
the whole thing was a "fake" foisted on
the public by the transportation compa
nies to Improve their business.
Whatever of truth there may have been
In these stories Is now of small import,
for in June or early July, some one of
the stranded miners tenting on the beach,
as the only unclaimed space, accidentally
discovered gold in the sand at his feet.
He told his story quickly among his
stranded friends, and soon all the unem
ployed were at work on the beach with
any and all kinds of tools that would
dig. Their success was such that within
a few days men who had work on
claims along the creek at $10 a day and
board threw up their jobs and took to
the beach, expecting to earn, and actual
ly earning in many instances, as much in
an hour as they had earned in a day.
Never had such easy mining brnn heard
Df, never had it been found so unex
pectedly and so opportunely, and it was
•lot long before everything else was 2
serted for the seashore, and even wo
olen and boys of 10 or 12 years were to bo
found as busy in the sand as the men
were.
Since the discovery the number of j
"beach combers," as they are called, has I
steadily increased, and today is presented
the strange' sight of hundreds of miners I
rof both sexes and all ages and condl- }
".ions strung out along the beach for a ;
rlozen miles or more.
For miles to the west of Cape Nome the [
oeach runs straight away In a strip of
;lde land, varying from forty to sixty
!eet in width between high and low water
mark, extending up to the "tundra" cr
black alluvial soil, which is from three
to five feet higher than the beach proper.
All of this tundra, ard all the territory
along the creeks and rivers east and west j
for thirty or forty miles and back into j
the mountains for ten or twelve miles had !
been staked, but on the long strip of tide i
lands no man had a better claim than j
another, or could have, under the tide- ;
land laws, and here the grand army of
gold seekers camped, and in very short ;
order had converted the barren strand '■
Into a site of tremendous and enthusiastic
Industry. At the same time business of
all kinds began to respond to the boom
i from the beach, and the usual collection
of gambling hells, saloons and dance
halls went Into operation. At present it
t ls estimated that 1,000 to 1,200 miners are
at work on the beach, extending west for
twenty miles. All these work with rock
_ ers, and they occupy just as much ter
~ ritory to the man or group as can work
It It is not unusual for one small square
bit of beach to pan out $10 to $15 an hour,
but, of course, the space is soon exhaust
ed and the lucky digger must move to
another snot.
. This beach deposit of gold Is as yet
an unsolved problem. By some It Is claim
ed that the gold In the sand, which is
entirely "dust," has been washed out
from the tundra by the waves at high
tide and deposited through hundreds of
years in the sand. It is found here now
from two to five feet below the surface In
the drift, and so plentiful that the miner
who does not find It In paying quantities
is the exception. On the other hand,
there are some who claim that the gold
is washed in from the sea, and that the
real field or "mother lode," so to speak.
Is to be reached and developed by dredg
ing. There may be something in this
theory, but the other seems to be the
more tenable, "-.ark'jpi^eya^fa^
The beach to the east of Cape Nome
makes no such gold showing as does the
beach to the west, owing to the existence
of a long reach of water or "lagoon,"
which lies a short distance back from
the sea and parallel with It. Gold deposits
along the creeks the interior are quite
as rich In one direction as the other.
The headquarters of the Cape Nome
territory is Anvil City—so named from
the shape" of the mountain above It—at
. the mouth of Snake river, although Nome
City is the postofflce. While the city pos
sesses a number of frame houses, tents
are the prevailing shelter, and prices for
commodities are pretty much as they are
In all mining towns. Notwithstanding
this is one of the most' accessible mining
towns on earth, as ships from any part
of the world may come up to its very
doors, making due allowances for no har
bor, and -much delay between ship '- and
shore in bad weather. Meals are from
•$1.50 to $2.50 each; a bed In a tent, $1.50;
plain drinks, 50 cents each; beer, 50 cents
per glass, and other things in proportion,
including a mutton chop at $I.2s—and, by
the way, these are not much in excess of
prices at first-class places ln New York
city. Copper plate for use In rockers is
worth Its weight In silver, and one miner
who had no copper substituted silver dol
lars for It, sixty-four of them being re
quired to properly plate his rocker, which,
added to the first cost of $20, made it
somewhat expensive, even for this local
ity. Labor in the mines Is worth from $8
to $10 a day and board, and even carpen
ters, about the only other class of labor,
are paid $1.50 and hour and board them
selves. As the days In summer are from
eighteen to twenty-four, hours long, a
carpenter can put In a lot of spare time.
Everybody has money, and as many who
have It are not used to It, they are lav
ishing their earnings by day on gambling,
liquor and dance halls at night. Gam
bling takes the bulk of the dust, and
every species of game is represented in
Anvil City.
As to what amount of geld is being
taken out, there Is no means of determin
ing. It is known that not more than $200,
--000 in all have been shipped by steamer,
and $100,000 of that has gone out within
the past week. The beach mining is re
ported to be turning out about $30,000 a
day, but this in the nature of things can
not continue, and when it is exhausted
these men will go to work on the numer
ous claims lying back from the sea and
along the creeks. Here the gold is found
In very rich deposits, the claim of Linde
burg- & Co., on Anvil Creek, turning out
over $1,000 an hour ($25,000 in twenty-four
hours),. one nugget recently found being
worth $312. Another claim, owned by Dr.
Kettlesen, in one day cleared* up $9,000,
and so the stories go. One may hear al
most any kind of a fairy tale, and while
some cf them are exaggerated the fact
remains that just now every man in the
district has a pocket full of dust and ?
heart full of hope, and there are no dead
brokes In- Anvil City. "What the condi
tions will be a year hence will not be
known until then, and cannot be pre
dicted.
Nov. 1 communication with - the outside
world will be completely shut off for sev
en month's at least, and only a few of
(he people now in the Cape Nome district
are fixed with either food or shelter for
the sever!- of the climate, though those
who are prepared with houses to live in
and sufficient food and fuel can not only'
pass the winter comfortably, but can do
more or less work.
There are very few so well eff as this,
however, fuel being scarcer than food,
but among the "beach combers" a novel
plan will be adopted. Parties of four,
six or eight will organize for winter op
erations by securing a large tent, spread
ing ii over the ground they propose to
work In, and there they, will set up house
keeping. The canvas will.be protected on
the outside from the weather in every
way possible, and stoves will be kept go
ing on the inside, so that the tent will not
only be comfortable to live and to work
in, but it will never freeze in there, and
the mining can go on quite as satisfac
torily as if the balmy spring were the
only season known in tho Cape Nome dis
trict A groat rush is expected in the
spring, but, as has been stated, there are
no claims unstaked anywhere . within
thirty or forty miles of Anvil City, and
what lies beyond those limits is pracfical
ly unknown. But, according to the tales
of prospectors, as far beyond as Cape
Prince of "Wales, 2:*5 miles, gold has been
found along the creaks in quantities that
would pay from $10 to $50 per man par
day if panned by an expert.
Claims are offered for sale—a claim be
ing twenty acres—at prices from $50,000
to $150,000, and there are, of course, at
this time not many takers at those, fig
ures, but they are expected In the spring
with the rush.
j -Over 1,000 claims—covering 20,000 acres,
i about thirty square miles of territory
j have been recorded, and It is generally
j believed that each claim represents a
| suit at law, so hasty and haphazard have
j been the methods of procedure in secur
ing claims.
The claims of this entire section are of
the placer variety, and so far no quartz
has been discovered, which means that
what is a busy mining camp with millions
this year may be a deserted village twelve
months later.
Nome gold is much darker in color than
the gold of the Yukon river country, as
saying $19 an ounce, though the current
trading price Is $18 an ounce. Gold dust
and nuggets constitute the bulk of the
currency, and gold scales are as neces
sary in the stores as the ordinary gro
cer's scales.- And gold dust as a circulat
ing medium Is not as popular as it might
be, for coin or paper money coihmandg
a premium of 7 per cent In many local
ities. Such money is known as "che'eha
ko," or "nev/comber." as only the new
arrivals have it, and that. Is the Eskimo
word for new arrivals.
Winter at Anvil City—that is to say, In
the entire Nome ordinarily con
tinues from October to June, and a tem
perature of 50 lo CO degrees below is not
unusual. On Dec. 21 the sun barely rises
above the horizon, and on "June 21 it does
not disappear entirely from sight during
the twenty-four hours.
To the prospective miner in ' the states"
expecting to try his luck in the.:* Cape
Nome rush next spring, or rather next
season, it may ba said.. that he should
keep his attention fixed on weather re
ports from the Northwest and be in San
Francisco, or Seattle. In June., to catch
the first boat out. as Norton bay usually
opens in June. What the faro wi'l be

the small steamers crossing the bay—
miles. The distance direct to Nome from
San Francisco Is about 2.800 miles, and
from Seattle or Tacoma 2,300 miles, and
competition has made the fare to St.*
Michaels the same. What changes the
rush of gold seekers next year will make
remains to be seen. It Is merely an or
dinary agreeable sea trip, and the miner
arriving at Nome Is practically In the
midst of his field of labor as soon as he
goes ashore, and there is little to do ex
cept become a millionaire as soon as con
venient. At the same time It may be re
marked with truth that if hejs comforta

"Call of the Wild,” Famous
Story of Yukon Gold
Rush, Stars Gable
• Call of the Wild-,” screen version
of Jack London's famous dog story,
plays Sunday at the Capitol The
ater. with Clark Gable and Jack
Oakie in the leading roles.
Although the story has ocen re
hashed in the studios to include a
love story and therefore a woman
(in this case. Loretta Young), and
although, in the rehashing, the orig- j
nal plot—that of a civilized dog's
'. eversion to wolf instincts—is so en
tirely lost that the writer of the
pre ent movie publicity forgot 11
mention even that there is a dog In
the picture, the new story is authen
tically London in local color and ad
venturousness, and if you haven't
read the book you will not be disap
nointed. It is one of the really good
■Pictures of the Yukon gold-rush,
vhich Jack London experienced as a j
boy of twenty.
London came to the Gold Rush as
the reaction to a year of hard study
at the University of California. Pre
viously he had. as a boy of fourteen,
left home to join the notorious "oys
ter-pirates” of San Francisco Bay.
He later shipped as a sailor on a
j chooner, as a salmon fisherman ai.d
; even joined a fish patrol. After a seal
! hunting expedition to Japan, he
went back to California and took
; jobs as coal-shoveller, long-shore
man and anything else that turned
up. He tramped a width of the coun
try and even served a term in Jail
■ fer vagrancy. While at the University
| he worked in a laundry to support
\ himself.
; The book, which is in the Juneau
I public library, is well worth any
j body’s reading, and the picture, while
it cannot be considered a faithful
reproduction of the masterpiece, is
i a worthy companion story.

        <text>HARDSHIPS IN ALASKA.
Gold Hunters Rushing Into Yukon
Country, Perhaps to Starvation.
Provisions High and Work Scarce—Doff
Meat Eaten During Past Winter to
Keep Alive—GrewAomc Reports
from Land of Promise.
News has been received from Forty
Mile, on the Yukon river, in Alaska, that
work there is scarce, provisions high
and that miners who go to the Yukon
country without money are certain to
have trouble and possibly to starve. Six
hundred men wintered at Circle City
and 800 more at Forty Mile. Several
thousand men are rushing in thisspring,
taking, in most instances, only enough
provisions to last them until they reach
the mining camps. As there are but
three steamers plying on the Yukon be
tween its mouth and the mining camps
it is very doubtful if enough supplies
can be taken up the river to feed these
thousands of men over another winter.
The number wintering on the Yukon
this winter will be at least three times
ns great as that last year. Recent let
ters state that provisions became so
scarce in some of the outlying districts
in January that dog meat had to be
resorted to in order to make the regular
provisions hold out until June, when the
first steamer will get up the river. It
is feared that some of the men in these
camps have died of starvation. These
reports have not in the least diminished
the great rush to Alaska. Within a
week 500 men have gone north. Half
of these will go to the Yukon and the
other half to Cook’s inlet.
A letter just received from Forty Mile
says:
"Of the 200 or 300 miners who left the
Yukon last fall nearly everyone was
“broke.” There were a dozen in our party
when we came In last March, some of whom
spent eight or ten years on the river, and
they were all “broke.” Still they had mado
people on the outside believe they were
rich. At present our best prospect is the
hope of getting trusted at the stores, but
if the miners are fortunate next summer
everything will be O. K. But few new pros
pects were opened up here last summer.
The problem I am trying to solve is the
buying of a whole year’s provisions, for
prices have gone up. If a man can make
enough money in the summer time to buy
a year’s grubstake and clothing he runs a
good chance of finding paying dirt by pros
pecting in the winter time. However, a
miner might live here 20 years and not find
a good prospect. At the present time,
January 25, the thermometer stands 70
degrees below zero.”
A. L. Smith, who went to the Yukon
country last year, writes:
"The mines haven’t turned out as well a.
expected. Provisions are very scarce at
some camps. The condition of exiles in
Siberia is preferable to living in this God
forsaken place.”
These letters are more discouraging
than any others received. Others say
that the Yukon is a good country for
men y ho have $5OO and can stand hard
knocks.' r •'

Advice to “Tentlerfeet” Who Are
Thinking of .Making a Rash
for the Rich Fields.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., July 17.-
At 3 o’clock this (Saturday) morning the
steamship Portland, from St Michael’s for
Sesattie, passed up the sound with more
than a ton of solid gold on board and many
passengers. In the captain's cabin are
three chests and a large safe filled with
the precious nuggets. The metal is worth
nearly $7u0,000, and the most of it wait
taken out of the ground in i*ss than three
months last winter. In size the nuggets
range from the size of a pea to a guinea
egg. Os the sixty-eight miners aboard hard
ly a man has less than S7,O(H), and one cr
two have more than SIOO,OOO in yellow nug
gets. One peculiar feature noticed is that
the big strikes were made by “tenderfeet,”
while the old and experienced miners of
many years’ experience are suffering in
describable hardships and privations in
Alaska and the Northwest Territory, and
have only a few thousand dollars to show
for their labor. Fortune seemed to smile on
the inexperienced men who went into the
mining districts late last year, as nearly all
of them were unfortunate. The
stories that they tell seem to
be incredible and far beyond be
lief. Instances are noted where single in
dividuals have taken out. in two and a half
months, gold to the value of over $150,000.
Clarence Berry, of Fresno, Cal., went to
the Yukon in 1890 and prospected several
years without success. He returned home
last autumn, was married and took his
bride to the Klondyke last November. He
is now- on the Portland with $135,000, the
result of a winter’s -work. Frank Phisca
ter, of Borado, Mich., is another lucky
miner. He went to the Kionayke last au
tumn and is now returning with $96,027, hav
ing worked two claims with nine men three
months, and he still owns the claims. He
was one of the original discoverers of the
Eldorado district. Although most of the
passengers are returning home with plenty
of gold they all advise and urge people who
contemplate going to the Y’ukon not to
think of taking less than one ton of grub
and plenty of clothing. While it is a poor
man’s country, yet the hardships and pri
vations to be encountered by inexperienced
persons unused to frontier life is certain to
result in much suffering. They should go
prepared with at least a year’s supplies.
COST OF AN OUTFIT.
Here’s a. Pointer for "Tenderfeet” Go
ing; to Alaska.
SAN FRANCISCO, July 17.—San Fran
cisco had a bad attack of gold fever, Fri
day, vffien the reports of the riph discover
ies in the Klondyke district were read.
Hundreds of old miners hunted up the meh
who arrived on the steamer Wednesday,
and obtained facts about the outfit and
money needed for the trip. Mr. J. C. Hest
wood, who has spent three years in Alas
ka, gave the best description of the chances
for the tenderfoot. He brought out SIO,OOO
as the result of two months’ w T ork on his
claim, which is about ten miles from Daw
son City. Mr. Hestwood said:
"To go into the Yukon requires $250 for
an outfit and about the same amount in
cash. To do anything in mining, except as
a day laborer, requires from $5,000 upwards.
The rich pay dirt is only struck near bed
rock, and this generally lies from eighteen
to twenty-five feet below the surface.
“The method of mining is to remove the
surface mass, which is eighteen inches
thick, and then build a fire, wffiich burns
all nig'nt. In the morning the gravel is
thawed down about two feet. This is shov
eled out and another fire is built, and in
this slow and laborious way the ground is
removed to bed rock. This work can be
carried on all winter, except when the mer
cury falls 60 below zero.
“Dawson City is a booming tow nos about
I, inhabitants, and is growing rapidly.
Provisions were scarce and dear last win
ter, and all supplies are costly. An ordi
nary seventy-flve-cent pocket knife sells for
$4. and shoes bring from $6 to SB. Eggs sell
readily at $4 per dozen. Flour sold as high
as $1 a pound.”
Mr. Hestwood showed many small nug
gets from the new Bonanza creek district,
where his mine is situated. The gold is the
color of brass and is worth sl6 to sl7 an
ounce. It is not as pure as is found else
where on the Yukon.
They did not hear of McKinley’s election
until last June, but Mr. Hestwood says
there were few silver men in camp. Some,
however, feared that gold would depreciate
in value because of the prospective enor
mous output of these mines.
The new camp is peculiar for several rea
sons. The prospectors don’t have a dead
man even once a week in Dawson City, the
headquarters of the camp, because Cana
dian provincial police do not allow men to
carry arms. If miners get drunk and fight
they use their fists, and the land laws are
so good that no claim jumping is possible.
Dawson City has now' four thousand people,
and it is expected that two thousand more
will swarm in before snow flies and the
trail from Juneau is closed for the winter.
J. O. Hestwood, one of the miners who
came back Wednesday, said:
“Modern history records nothing so rich
in extent as the placer mines of the Yukon
district. The gold dust which was turned
into the Sebly Smelting Company’s office
Wednesday is only a slight Indication of
what is to follow in the near future. The
climatic conditions of that ice-bound re
gion are such. how*ever, that only the very
courageous should seek fortunes there.
Food is scarce, distances to be traversed
are great and the country is inhospitable.
“A great many men went into the coun
try poverty stricken last year and came out
this spring with thousands of dollars, yet
that does not signify that every chu-chow
ko (newcomer) will be able to do the same.
There is plenty of room there for five thou
sand more able-bodied men. but let no one
undertake the task of getting there until
ho first considers what he must bear and
undergo to reach the El Dorado of the far
north, remembering that wealth from min
ing in that region, as a rule, is more acci
dental than o.herwfse.”
The stories of returned miners vary onty
in details. L B. Rhodes, an old miner,
tells the following history of his good for
tune: “1 am located on Claim 21, above
Discovery, on Bonanza creek. I was among
the fortunate, as I cleared about $400,060,
but brought only $5,000 with me. I was the
first man to get to bedrock gravel and to
discover that it was lined with gold dust
and nuggets. Tne rock was seamed and
had V-shaped streaks, caused, it is sup
posed, by glacial action. In those seams I
found a clay which was exceedingly rich;
in fact, there was a stratum of pay gravel
four feet thick upon the rock, which was
lined with gold, particularly in those chan
nels or streaks. The rock was about six
teen feet from the surface. That discovery
made th’e camp. It was made on Oct.
23, 1896, and as soon as the news spread
everybody rushvd to the diggings from Cir
cle City, Forty Mile and every other camp
in the district. There was a lack of food.
We had nothing but w hat we sledded from
Forty Mile. Flour sold as high as $45 a
suck, and shovels at $lB apffiee. I Invested
my money in another claim, a two-thirds
divided interest in Claim 23. If I had not
bought in 1 would have brought down at
least $25,000, but the investment there is
the best security and pays interest from
15 to 25 per cent, a year.”
Fred Brice said that there were four
miles of good claims on El Dorado creek
and ten miles of claims on Bonanza creek.
He brought down sj*uoo and left $’:0,000 in
vested in the gold flaim. He warned all
prospectors to take full outfits, as there
was no credit at the stores, even if a man
is starving.

GOING TO THE KLONDYKE.
Expedition* to the Gold Field Prepar
ing; to Stnrt ut Onee.
SEATTLE, Wash., July 17. —“When are
you going to the Klondyke?” In twelve
hours that question has been asked and
answered a hundred thousand times In Se
attle. On the streets, in the houses, every
where is heard nothing but Klondyke, and
the whole town is ieverish and agitated as
never before over the Alaska gold discover
ies. Men who cannot go are forming pools
to grubstake men wffio will. Ex-Governor
John H. McGraw ■will leave on the next
steamer. Gen. E. M. Carr, of the State mil
itia, who at one time camped within seven
miles of the fabulously rich placer, will go.
Col. Joe Green and A. J. Balliet, Y'ale’s
great oarsman, are packing their effects,
and attorneys, doctors, clerks and laborers
are all scheming to secure a share of the
vast wealth in the north.
Indescribable expectation is directed
toward the steamer Portland, due at any
hour from St. Michael's. She has at least
a million dollars in gold aboard and will
bring news of Seattle men who have risked
their lives for gold. Every one says that
at last the mother lode of the Pacific coast
has been found and that the half has not
been told. The reports have caused intense
excitement here. Policemen are resigning
from the force; every street-car man that
can raise a stake has given notice to his
company. In fact, all classes of society
are represented in the feverish rush to get
north. The men neglect their business and
congregate in groups on the streets in ex
cited discission. People are telegraphing
friends and relatives in the East to come
and join them in the new Eldorado. The
steamer Portland has not yet been reported
at Tattosh and her coming is awaited with
intense anxiety. She will probably arrive
some time to-morrow, and is billed to sail
July 20 on her return voyage. The steamer
offices are rushed with business and out
fitting stores are taxed to their utmost ca
pacity to supply the wants of those who are
getting ready to make the trip. Merchants
are fearful that their help will leave them
and they will be unable to fill their places.

Excitement Greater in Alaska Than
Anywhere.
Port Tqwnsend, Wash , July 20
Tho excursion steamer Queen' ar
rived from Alaska with 170 passen
gers, principally tourists.
If reports be not overdrawn by the
ofliccrs of the Queen, the excitement
at Juneau over the rich gold ilnds In
tho Klondyke country Is much more
Intense than herein tho Pacific states
Merchants and tradesmen in both
Juneau and Sitka arc closing their
stores and shops and hastening to the
new Eldorado.
Fifty business men left Juneau for
Dawson City on the Klondyke July 12,
and 150 would leave on the 10th, two
days after the Queen sailed. The of
liccrs said that by tho time tho Queen
returns to Juneau on her regular trip,
nine days hence, there will not be an
able-bodied man left in town. Many
men aro leaving Juneau for the gold
Holds without provisions or means to
buy them.
The fow Alaskans who came down
on tho Queen were greatly gratified to
learn of the appointment of C. S.
Johnson, of Juneau, to the position of
United States attorney for that dis
trict. Johson was appointed to the
same position -in 1880, going north
from Nebraska. His prosecutions
were so vigorous as to win for him an
envlablo rcputatatfon, henco tho ex
ulting of tho Alaskans at'Wf6 present
appolntmtint.
Reports fro m tho various salmon
fisheries in Alaska arc that fish are
very scarce. Tho fishing season at
Orca has been very poor so far and a
small pack will bo made. Tho Pacific
Steam Whaling company has packed
to dato 15,000 cases of red salmon and
tho Alaska Packers' association about
8000 cases . Tho prospect for tho pack
at Cook inlet Is very good, tish having
commenced to run fairly well. At
Karluk, the salmon have just com
menced to run nnd tho outlook Is not
encouraging for the spring run.
The Pacific Steam Whaling com
pany and numo brothers have built
two largo cannery plants at Karluk
this 6eason. Tho Psciflc Steam Wha
ling company is at tho present time
building a largo cannery nt Kcnal
river, Cook inlet.
Tho manager of tho Oceanic Pack
ing company at Point Roberts in
formed the Associated Press corres
pondent today that from tho com
panys four traps neqr San Juan pass
an average of 20,000 sockoyo salmon
aro being taken daily. Such a heavy
run is unprecedented.

aged Partial Liht of Dead and
Disabled Accident Occurred ut
Treuiunt and lloylbtoti Streets.
Boston, March 4. An explosion lias just
occurred in the subway excavation at the
corner of Trcraont and Ooylston streets.
Three electric cars that were passing
at the time were wrecked and one ot
them was burned. Several bulldingsin the
vicinity were more or less damaged.
The explosion was caused by escaping
gas.
Among the buildings damaged are the
Hotel Pclliam, the Knickerbocker and
Head buildings and the Masonic Temple.
Window glass in buildings within 200
feet of the scene of the explosion were
shattered.
At least twelve persons were killed.
Four bodies have been removed to un
dertaking' rooms.
Forty-two persons arc at the Emergency
Hospital.
Among the dead are:
Rev. W. A. Slack, professor at Tufts Col
lege. G. I). Bigclow, conductor.
Unknown man and woman.
The injured include James Reardon, John
J. O'Conuor, Thomas F. Ford, Mrs. J. R.
Wilson, Nellie Jackson, Lucy Dolan, F.
W. Tceling, and Mrs. F. A. reck
There seems to be no doubt thatatleast
eight persons were immediately killed.
The explosion came Jutt as the streetcars
were almost in the ceutcr of the space at
the corner.
The first car was In the center when the
explosion came. The whole of the wood
work, which is used as a bridge over the
subway, was lifted into the air, carrying
the first car with it and taking along the
two horses of the second car. The other
Tehlcles were lifted straight into the air,
but came down on the tracks. Instantly
the air was filled with flying debris.
The firat electric car, the one in which
most or the killed were riding, no sooner
reached the track than It broke in hair,
and the whole portion Immediately burst
into flame. Then someone sounded a fire
alarm. This brought a large rescue force
to the scene, and almost immediately calls
were being sent out hurriedly for the am
bulances. It was an awful Eight that met the gaze
of those who were first on the scene. In
the center was the long blazing electric
car. .Close beride this were the bodies ot
the two horses killed instantly, and about
ten, twenty, thirty feet away from where
the woodwork of the car was blazing lay
the dead and wounded people. Those who
wore not injured in the cars on Boylston
6treet were Incapable ot action
at first, and people in the buildings and
stores surrounding did not know what had
occurred, but it did not take them long
to secure their senses, and almost imme
diately there was a rush to the assistance
ot the wounded.
It is stated that there was not a person
on the three cars who was not injured, and
all the wounds received were severe. Im
mediately stores and offices were con
verted into temporary hospitals until am
bulances could arrive. 1 1 was a gruesome
spectacle to see these bodies exposed on
the sidewalks.
Hose carriages were pressed into service
as ambulances, and immediately they were
started on their humane duty or getting the
maimed to the hospitals.
It Is supposed that-one of the dead women
at Jones' undertaking rooms Is Mrs. A. M.
Bates. She was out wlth a sister this
morning and has not returned. The sister

        THE BOSTON SUBWAY
SATISFACTORY SOLUTION OF THE
STREET CAR PROBLEM.
Contention of Trafllc In tli? Iluny Streets
of the Uub Relieved by Underground |
Trolley Lines?Tunnels Tlmt Am Light, |
Clean uud Attractive.
It is now possible to cross Tromont
street, Boston, at any point opposite tho
Common and at any time of day without
loss of life or limb. Tho new subway has
brought about tho change.
It 1 s an old tradition that tho fathers of
Boston, when thoy laid out tho city, let
the. streets follow the winding cow paths.
At any rate, the streets ius thoy exist today
urc very crooked and must of them aro
very narrow. This was all right in Revo?
lutionary times, but when the city grow
miles beyond tho Common und spread it?
self out to tho south and west; when busi?
ness centered itself along tbu lower ends
of Washington and Trentont streets, and
when dozens of street car tracks usurped
tho narrow roadways, then the Bostonlans
wished their ancestors bud not stuck so
closely to the cow paths.
Probably no other city on the continent,
was ever so badly allllctcd with a conges?
tion of trnllic as tho Hub haslieon for
many yea: . . Some of tho most important
street ear linen skirt tho south and east,
cornets ol the Common on Boylston mid
Tremont streets. When I he chango was
made hum hoc. epov.vr to trolley, matters
grew worse. Then tho poles and the tan?
gle of overhead wires made that historic.
breathing spot look liko a pieco of dingy,
green billiard cloth which had become fray?
ed and tuttered around the edges. So after
much wrangling in tho legislature and
courts it w;ls decided tu build the subway
and put the trolley cars underground.
A large portion of the work bus already
lieen accomplished and Boston is delight?
ed with the result. The first thing a Hus?
ton man asks a visitor from Now York,
Chicago or elsewhere is:
"Been through tho subway yet'/ Let's
see?you huven't one in your place, have
you?"
It is, in fact, a triumph of engineering
anil well worth a visit. Then! arc throe
open cut.s where tho trolley curs enter the
subway. One Is out on Tremont street
whore Shawmut avenue comes in. Hero
the tracks from each of those jmorough
fares dive into the tunnel. Another is In

along the Common side and the main line
down Tremont to Park street are in oper?
ation. The Shawmut avenue branch and
tho northerly end of the main lino will be
finished within the next eight months.
Ground was broken for the subway in
April, 18115. The sum appropriated was
$7,ii(?0,000 and, wonderful to relate, tho
transit commissioners say that it is proba?
ble the cost will bo about $1,000,000 less
than that sum.
No groat difficulties have been encoun?
tered thus far in digging this big liplo In
the ground. Of course there were count?
less sewers, water pipes, gas pipes, electric
wire conduits and the like und some -III
inch water mains at an inconvenient level
proved rather hnrxl to handle, but n? un?
expected conditions arose to delay tho
work. The main trunk of the subway
runs under the wide walk or mall on tho
east side of the Common, anil when the
excavations were being made the bones of
hundreds of old Puritans were disturbed.
This raised a bowl of righteous Indigna?
tion,and the sncredness of the long forgot
burying ground was harped upon for
weeks. Hut the commissioners quieted
the reverent patriots by collecting nil tho
bones and roiuterrlng them in the holy
ground of the Common, with a nice monu?
ment to mark the spot.
The tleepest jioint of tho subway is on
Boylston street, where the south bound
t racks are laid lit) feet lielow the surface,
but the average depth is 14 feet. The tun?
nel itself is a giant bore with ribs of steel
mid casings! of cement, asphalt, concrete
and masonry. The roof is a series of
arches und the floor Is concave, with
drains at the bottom. As tho drnins are
below the level of the sewers, jilts have
been established at Intervals, and when
thev are filled with water automatic elec?
trical pumps are started, which empty
them Into tho sewers above.
Perhaps yon imagine that Boston's sub?
way is a tlark, damp, ill smelling place. It
is nothing of the sort. The entrances to
the stations aro handsome structures of
stone, with glass roofs. The only fault, to
be found with them is that thev remind

Jl&B passenger tunnel work any whero In the world,

B9p The tunnel runs under Tremont street, and
HHk Its extensions are to go under Cornhlll, Han
JJ. oxer street, and Washington streot, passing
i right through the denso business and shopping
) districts, and thus securing every advantage
I that a road might have If It ran through Broad-
jf ( Tray, Fourteenth street and Twenty-third street,
i ( and part of Sixth avenue. And yet. In the face
j ef all these advantages, three months' experi
ence has shown that the Boston subway is not
popular, that people will not go Into It ex-
cept when they have to, and that the subway Is
lv a failure, save so far as It was a necosslty to re-
i'i Have the congestion of traffic on the street.
V XEED OF TUB BUDWAT.
A Bostonlans are proud of the subway. They
ri take strangers to see It, just as they take them
h to see Bunker IIIll Monument; make them ride
vM the length of It back and forth, and call alien
s' I tlon to all its fine foatures and then they keep
& I away from it themsolves. Just as thoydofrom
if ( the monument. That this result ls of tntorest
I V to New Yorkers there can be no doubt. Tho
?; building of tbo subway growoutof a publloneed
-., Tfhloh was as absolute and pressing as the need
v ef this city for some addition to Its trafllo
in. facilities.
Hien, about ten years ago. the West End
oet Railway Company began to transform tho
horso car lines of Boston Into electric trot
lines the narrow streets In tho heart of
iton were already choked with tho dally rush
vehicles. Boston has to-day tho most ex
stve and comprehensive electrlo car system
the world. The added cars which wero re
red for tho now service fairly filled
i streets of the little central city
ere they were all concentrated. These
' lines eorvo a suburban population of
trly a million persons, and it is possible to
;e a car for any part of the territory covered
.hoot going more thai a quarter of a mllo In .
i city. Under a special act of the Lcglsla
e the Boston Transit Commission was ap
nted to devise a suitable means to relieve the
Station.
THE OrERATIVB COWTnAOT.
fader this commission tho subway wns
nned and is being built. Tho city of Boston
s for it and leases it to tho West End Street
llway Company for twenty years at an an
il rental which is not to be less than 4Ts per
it. upon the net cost of the tunnel, or more
,n .Ts per cent, upon tho sum of $7,000,000,
he tunnol should cost so much, and tho com
ly agrees to pay. in llou of interest, a toll of
nts for each car that passes through the
way. In caso the aggregate of tolls should
:eed the interest charges. The railroad com
ly cares for it, lights it, ventilates it, ana
ips It free from wator. i
fork was bosun on the subway on March 28,
13, and on Sept. 1 of this rear the first scc
o was put Into use. A second socllon was put
o use on Sept. 30. The main part of tbo sub
y now in use lies usdor Tremont street, bo
sen Park street and Boylst:n street. This
lion 'Is 1,700 feet long and contains four
cks. At both ends aro stations, built
nmodlously under ground and approached
m the surface by wide, easy stair
ye. wulch are protected by small or
mental stone buildings. At the BoyI
in street station the tunnel divides into
o two-tracked sections. Ono of these con
ues under Tremont street for about 1,200
it, whon its comes to tho surfaco and empties
cars upon the tracks in Tremont street and
awmut avenue, which hero diverge. The
ler branch turns sharply to the wostward,
asunder the edge of tho famous Common, to
Public Oarden beyond Ohnrles street, where
comes to tho surfaco, 1,200 foet from the
ylston streot station, and its cars goon tholr
y down Boylston street,
man standahd or coxsTitucnos.
The tunnel Is kept almost as light as day
im end to end. At the stations It ls lined on
) sides with enamelled white brick. Through
t its length and on tho codings at tho
itlons It Is pnlnted white. At tlio su
ns and through the tunnol electric
hts aro hung In abundance, and to make
re that these shall not all fall at any ono tlnio
5y are divided nnd fed by two scparato clr
Its of wire, resides these lights, fixed In the
itnel, are the lights In tho passing cars, which
kept lit In making the tunnel passage. As
oorthreocarsaro passing In each direction
ery minute almost all the tliuo, their lights
me would keep it fairly well illuminated.
People doclare that they found the tunnel ro
ishlngly cool during the warm woather In Sep
nber Just after it was oponed, and In cold
lather they find It warm. No winds penetrato
and the moraont a porson gets to tho stairs at
itatlon he Is out of rench of storms. Only ono
jrce of discomfort has yet developed In tho
e of the tunnel, and that. It U belloved,
11 be remedied. This was, for the tlmo
lasted, a very groat trouble. It occurred
it month, when there had been a sudden
ange of 25 or 30 degrees in temperature,
oweathorhad been cold for thrco or four

log began to weep. The cold roof and sides of
e tunnel condensed tho moisture In the
irraer air, and In a short tlmo the
jole Interior glistened with molsturu.
. the stations tho condition was worst nnd pro
ced much discomfort. Here the air entered,
dof course gavo tin the greater part of its
ilsture. Most of tho moisture collected on tho
ling nnd dripped dnujion thn waiting passen
rs. People who had loft pleasant neathar
stairs found themselves exposed to trick
m streams below. It wns so bad that tbo
llroad company sot men to work scrnp
K down the roofs and Bides with riihbcr
urezers to gut rid of tho moisture. Even

" One thing to be seen from theso Ilguros," Mr.
Llttlo added, " Is that tho sulmny, although It
runs pistn number of the principal theatres,
does not get any appreciable quantiij- of that
strictly fancy riding, tho people going homo
from tbo theatres, any more than It gets the

" On rainy days ono would suppose that tho
subway would get n bigger proportion of trafllo
than in flno weather; but this ls not true. I
mot Mr. Dalton. ono of tho Transit Commission,
the other day when It wns mining, at tho en
trance to tho Park street station.
'"Isn't this chnrnilngl' he exclaimed as he
got In out of the storm.
"I admitted th-it It was; but when I camoto
look over tha tables of daily receipts and com
pare thom with the total tralllo I found that
although tho general trafllo had fallen off less
than 0 per cent, because of tbo rainy dny, tho
subway traffic had lost 30 per cent. This Is the
rooro significant from tho fact that one
half the former number of cars nro now oft tho
streets above."
A reference to tho dally tablos showed how '
tho travel In the subway fell off In unpleasant
weather. On Nor. 2, when tho usual dally
Irrffllc was 22,000 or 23,000 persons, only
14.000 went through tho subway. On Nov. 2a
tho number roll to 13,000, while tho next dny It
roso to 24,000. On Sundays, when tho tratllc
on nil parts of tho system ls fancy riding prin
cipally, tho number of passongers who go
through tbo subway falls as low as 0,000.
FACT8 FOR NEW YORK TO 1-0NDER,
These aro tho facta. If It wcro possible to
build tbo long tunnel proposed for this city nnd
mal.o all parts of It ns perfect ns tho Boston
subway, which is at least doubtful, what would
be thn effect of an oqual Indisposition of Now
Yorkers to using it upon tho chances of Its pay
ing I Tho proposed road would have enough to
contend with through tho location of its main
linos out of tho way of tho short-ride local
business, out of which alone profit ls to
be made; but If the fancy traffic avoided It, ns
It avoids the lloston subway, tho result would
bo ruinous, Tho contractors would find them
selves with no ono to carry except tho people
who wanted to ride to Harlem and far above
or to Klngsbrldge, all for fire cents, and. what
ever forfeit they had to make, they would soon
abandon tho lino for thn city to operate at a loss.
CACHES OF rUPLIC PREJUDICE.
Why the peoplo avoid tho subway Is a ques
tion much discussed. Perhaps as good nn ex
planation ns anr Is to bo found in a conversa
tion which took place between Tun Sun re
porter who gathered these fncts nnd the pretty
&lrl who Owns the news stnnd at one of Boston's
est hotels.
"Ilavo you beon through the subway yet I"
ho asked enthusiastically.
"Yes," the reporter nnswored.
"I have just been through It, Isn't It grand!"
she exclaimed.
"l)o you go through it of ten I" asked tho re
porter curiously.
"Ob, no!" Bho answered. "I think It's beau
tiful, so light, and dry, and comfort bio: but I
always take a surfaco car. I think I hate to
walk up the stairs, although I am not lazy. I
walk clear out to ltoxbury and back almost
ever' day, and have lost slxteon pounds by
doing so, but, somehow, I don't llko to go up and
down stairs In tho subway."
It ls probably something more than this thnt
deters people from going underground even In a
tunnel bo well lighted. It is well known thnt
the underground roads In London do not pay,
nnd this ls duo largely to tho lack of tho fnncy
trafflc, such as overflows surface lines and ele
vated roads In New York. Ask a Londoner If
he uses tho underground roads in his own city
much, and IiIb answer Is almost suro to bo:
"Oh, yes, but only when lhavo to."
NOW BOSTON WANTS AN ELEVATED ROAD.
That Boston has awakened to the fact that
subways arc not n good thing whero they can be
avoided. Is clear from the character of tho very
latest move now on foot there. This ls to build
elevated railroads from tho ends of the subway,
nnd thus, in thoopen air, enrry tho cars out be
yond the thickly built-UD sections to Rnx
bury, Cambridge, Cbarlestown, and be
jond. This plan ls to be carried out ns
soon as tho Stato Railroad Commission agrees
to a lease of the West End road's lines to the
new elevated railroad company.

threw hundreds of men nnd women
into a panic nnd paralyzed trnfflc ln
the subwny nt the Boylston street
statlon at 5.30 o'clock, Wednesday af-
ternqpn
No one know the trouble. Elevatcd
road employes and offlclals were allke
confused, and fearful of what mlght
come next, fla tho smoko raphlly fllleil
tho stntloim at Boylston and Park
streets, nnd passengers wers rushed
from tlie cars to the surfacc.
Tralnmen nnd statlon pollce at
tempted to call the flrd departmont
and found tho telephones so charged
wlth clectrlclty as to be useless.
Mnny of the women reachlng the
subway by the Boylston street cars
were overcomo by the smoko, falnted,
nnd had to be dragged to the surfnce.
Several becanio hysterlcal and woro
controlled wlth much dimculty, the
danger belng constant of Bomeono
falllng from tho platforms overcome
by tho smoko and becomlng electro
cuted upon the deadly thlrd rall.
Tralnmaster Benjamln wns the flrst
offlclal to reach the Boylston street
statlon and to brlng some sort of or-
der out of tho cliaos. Enterlng the
subway along the llne of the north
bound cars he made hla way some 100
feet to the south of tlie statlon and
found the cause of the trouble.
. The feed cables for the thlrd rall,
runnlng between the ralla and en
closed ln four-inch wooden box con
dults, were found grouuded and
throwlng off flashes of electrlclty,
whlch llluminnted the subway for
tnany hundreds of feet. The electrl
clty had jumped to other cables run
nlng parallel, and even charged the
wnlla of the subway. Ten powerful
cables felt the lnftuence of the crosn
nnd were cracklng nnd throwlng off
flames and flashes of llght, threaten
Ing death to any who cnme near.
Tho wooden box condtilt, black and
greasy and very Inflammable, was
burnlng rapldly. A north bound traln
whlch had passed over the spot got
nflro nnd wna inillod bnnk lo Waont

Tlie terrlfled passengers were hnnied

done.
Three persons were hurt, nnd all of
them were on the surface. The nccl

the dlrect result of the trouble In tbo
subway. The Injured wero all near
the Pleasant street entrance to tho
Biibwny and were hurt by the explo

Tralnmaster Benjamln ordered all
tralns Into statlons, and then the cnr-
rent on the thlrd rall and feed cables
was shut off.
Chlef Mullcn and the flre depart

power was shut off and entered tho
nubway nt the Boylston street sta
tlon, although there was great danger
for anyone, however famlllar ylth the
subway, to enter ln tlie dense smoke
whlch flllcd every foot of space be

As Chlef Mullen's men toucbed the
walls thoy felt a shock at once. The

Thomas
Lawson's Confidential Man
Dies In Subway.
Boston, Dec. 1. John F. Donohue,
many years the confidential man of J.
Edward Addicks aud of Thomas W.
Lawsou, committed suicide by throw-!
lng himself before a fast moving train ,
in the subway. Deatli was install Ui- i
neous.
For about fifteen minutes Mr. Dono
hue had been pacing the station plat
form, walking to tho edge and looking
down at the rails and peering up and
down the track. Just before a north
bound train drew up Mr. Donohue
dropped a light cane lie had been car
rying and jumped into the train pit
His family furnished no explanation
for the act. Friends say he had been
suffering from stomach trouble about
a year. He was sixty years old and a
native of Ireland and for a time was
engaged lu shoe manufacturing In
Lynn, Mass.
Mr. Donohue was known as "Law
son's Man Friday." About three years
ago he broke with Lawson nnd filed a
suit for $250,000 against him, assert
ing that amount was due him for con
fidential services for a long period.
Among tho thirty-three specifications
in the suit was the delivery to Law
son of the books of the Bay State Gas
Companies of Delaware and New Jer
sey. This, he said, enabled Lawson to
make terms to his advantage with tho
late Henry H. Itogers.
He also said that he had arranged
for a meeting between Lawson, Itog
ers and F. Augustus Helnze In the

        <text>BOSTON'S SUBWAY, SURFACE AND ELEVATED LINES
PRACTICALLY TIED UP BY STRIKE
Boston, June 7. By noon to
day the surface, elevated and sub
way car system of Boston and
suburbs was utterly disorganized.
A strike of the union employes
of the Boston Elevated, which
controls the surface and subway
lines, was called at 4:15 o'clock
this morning after a stormy three
hour session at union headquar
ters. The elevated officials laughed
at the strike. When the union was
formed only a few weeks ago the
elevated set about a counter or
ganization, a "protective" asso
ciation they called it.
This morning the officials of
the company claimed they had
2,000 men in this protective asso
ciation who would continue to
work, and that they had 1,500
strike-breakers already imported
from New York and Philadelphia.
There was a good deal of riot
ing after the strike was called.
Cars wer.e stoned, trolleys discon
nected, motormen and conductors
who refused to recognize the
strike order roughly handled,
le,epers were put on the tracks,
and cautious Bostonians walked
to work this morning.
But the rioting never became
very serious and it was not neces
sary. As the forenoon wore on
motormen after motormen, and
conductor after conductor left
their 'packed cars standing'in the
street and went to union head
quarters to report.
Even wherfe they did not leave
the cars there always was some
one to disconnect the trolley
wires. Then the motormen and
conductors would refuse to get
off to fix it, and the police would
have to do it.
Because the guards at the
Park street terminal of the Cam-
bridge subway reported to the
union the escalators were stopped
and passengers had to climb three
flights of stairs to the street.
There are 3,800 members of the
union. The strike was called be
cause :
The company refused to recog
nize the union; announced it
would employ no union .men.
When complaints were made
against men, they were laid off
without pay pending a hearing.
If exonerated and reinstated,
the pay they lost never was made
up. i
Conductors were forced to fur
nish $10 change for each trip.
Despite the company's refusal
of an increase because their
"finances wquld not stand it,"
the "loyal federation or protec
tive asspciation" members' pay
was increased when the union
was formed.
Police Commissioner O'Meara
ordered all the reserves on duty
at the subway and elevated, sta
tions and car barns this forenoon.
There already have been fifty arm
rests, but all the cases were con
tinued until oMnday.

The wage scale was agrced upon
after an ali day confercnce at tlT5
State House and in the Hotel Tou

the fiat wage of 73 cents an hour
which formed the basis of the car

The arbitrators also reward an

        <text>A Great National Park.
Hon. N. P. Langford, of Slontann, the
leader of the famous Yellowstone expedi
tion of last year, is now in Washington,
and, in eonneetion with Professor Hayden,
who had charge of the government expedi
tion of this year, is engaged in promoting
the project of declaring all that district, in
cluding the canon of the Yellowstone, the
hot springs and the geysers a government
reservation, for the purpose of holding it
forever as a national park. • Copies of the
May and June numbers ot Scribner's Month
ly. containing Langford's graphic story of
"Tnc Wonders ol the Yellowstone," have
been furnished to every member of Con
gress. Professor Hayden lias prepared an
article f«r the February number of Scrib
ner's. in which he confirms Langford's ac
count. describes additional marvels discov
d by himself, aud takes strong ground
in favor of the park project. Such a park
will, in time, attract to it crowds of the
pleasure seekers and scientists of Europe
It is not only remarkable for its scenery,
but in a scientific point of view is said to
be "the most marvelous region on the face
of the earth." The illustrations, which are
to appear in the February number of Scrib
tier, are lroin photographs taken by the re
cent expedition.

Ural of Scrlos of Illustrated Letters
Devoted to the Curioui and

Written for Tire Trllntne.
Here boglns another chnpter of our
Story. Having crnssed the continent
over the main line of the Northern J'n
elllo railway and witnessed. Its Rrnmli'tir
vt scenery and Hiirnrlws for twenty
ftBht suifesHlve days, we will retrace
our HtepH tor two thousand inlloa to
LlvliiRston and Rather up Home of the
wonderful scenery we lost In linssin";.
We will re-enter for that purpose the
portal of the Yellowstone National
Park, "Tho Wonderland of North
America."
When this Indian reservation was
set aside to be forever the Brand tourist
reHort of the people and their common
property by the peneral Kovernnient,
few had any Idea of the endless variety
and stupendous grandeur of the fea
tures embraced In tills tract of country
Klxty-five by seventy-five miles In ex
tent. This volcanic, region Is located
about midway in our national domain.
It nestles in the heart of the Kooky
mountains covering un nrea of :i.57;i
mpiure miles and Is encircled by ning
liillcent snow peaks from ten to nearly
fourteen thousand feet high. No valley
within its limits has an elevation less
than G.000 feet above sea level, while the
averaK Is about H.UuO feet. This freak
of nature is only a little spot of earth
in the northwest coiner of Wyoming,
coverliiff a few miles of Montana on the
north and overlapping into Idaho and
Montana on the west. It is one
of thu preatPst water-sheds on the
earth. Three of the larRest rivers in
the United States have their source in
Yellowstone park tho Missouri, the
Yellowstone, the Snake. These Htrenins
born within HlRlit of each other, lose
themselves in three mighty rivers that
seek old ocean thousands of miles apart
from each other. Here, too, is the lar
Reat body of water in North America

Within this wonderful domain are fifty

legulurly a column of hot water from
thirty to two hundred and lifty feet
in the air between intervals of from

within the boundaries of this wonder

una hundred geysers and 3.600 springs
and pools, together with paint pots,
mud springs, lukes canyons, rivers and
small parks, ad infinitum. Here in the

of a quarter of a mile which 1 ac

that liuve such beauty and magnitude;
also cliffs of volcanic glass, mountains
of petrefactlon, hills or brimstone, un
surpassed waterfalls, interspersed with
thousands of natural curiosities, sur
rounded by perpetual snow clad peaks
which rise Into cloudland. all of which
fittingly characterize this as the won
derland of America and of the world.
' ITS HISTORY AND DISCOVERY.
This weird and enchanted spot Is only
M recent .discovery. Often did the
thought occur to us as w traversed it,
, why was it so long undiscovered. It
was not until 1870 that this remarkable
locality became known, although as far
bark as 1S06 some Inkling of what was
to be found there was Riven bv the
Lewis and Clark exploring expedition.
The stories then told came largely
from frontier guides and mountaineers
and were disbelieved, and more than
Ixty years elapsed before the residents
of Montana attempted to explore it,
althought several expeditions sent out
by the government had crossed the con
tinent In search of the most suitable
route for the Pacific railway; in fact.
the whole western domain was crossed
and re-crossed by these exploring
parties, and still the Yellowstone Park
country remained undiscovered. It was
left to John Colter (the first white ex
plorer) to know and tell of its wonders,
and then to General Washburn, in 1870,
to enter the Inner wilds of this myster
ious land, escorted by Lieutenant
Doaae, of the United States army, and
in 1871-72 for Professor P. T. Hayden,
United States geologist, to make a
thorough discovery under the sanction
of congress and largely through his ln-

fluence and efforts it became a national
reservation. It peonis strange that a
region so remarkable as this, was so
long an unknown land to us. That,
this is so. Is undoubtedly mvlng to the
fact that from the east and south the
Park Is almost impossible of approach
on account of the character of the
mountains. Tho region is more than
lifty miles south of the nearest route
traveled by explorers, besides hostile
Indians were in this Immediate vicinity
in very early days. Hut the question
is aptly unsweivtl by Mr. O. 1). Wheel

until the American people were suf
ficiently able to appreciate it. as to
preserve it In nil tts Integrity, its nat
ural grandeur and beauty forever. Just
us nature made it." Since the Park
was reserved for Its present purpose,
congress has set aside as a "timber re
serve" nnother tract on the south and
east of about two thousand Bqunre
miles, making the- entire reservation
one-fourth larger than my native state,
Connecticut. This ni t prevents the tim

SPRINGS HOTEL.
The completion of the Northern rarlfic
railway across the continent was an
important event for the Park, espe
cially so when their branch line of
fifty-one miles brought them to Cinna
bar at its northern boundary. Thin
road brings the tourist from his far
away home and sets him down amidst
the mountains and confines of this
wonderland. "Thus far und no far
ther," said Mr. Wheeler to t ie, "i
Uncle Sam's edict to railroads, and
none may venture beyond the imagin
ary boundary line."
Connected with the Park are four
Important factors, each Independent of
the other, yet co-ordinate branches.
These are the United States govern
ment, the Northern Pacific railway, the
V - eV- '"TZ- AT'W
Yellowstone Pork association, and tho
Yellowstone National Park Transpor
tation compuny. Like four separate,
yet integral parts of the samo machine,
thry work sympathetically and ,Jhar
ninnioutdy toward tho same end. The
avenue of annrouvh. to the Park Is one
entirely in keeping with its character.
Having given our readers a condensed
outline of this mysterious land of won
ders, we will invite them to follow us
in our dally travels through It. We
leave the main line of the road and
start in to see the park at Livingston,
for it's only through Livingston on the
Northern Pacific road, that we can
reach it. Livingston as described In a
former letter, lies at the base of the
Know and Helt ranges spurs of the
Kocky mountains.
Some people, like ourselves, have an
idea, that we enter the Park on the
same elevation above the sea, ami in
the same manner as itv would enter
Kaliniount Park, of Philadelphia, or
Central Park, New York. This Is a
mistaken idea we commence at Llv
iiiKslon on elevation above sea level
hi 4.4 .0 feet, urn! ascend to Cinnabar,
filfy-uiie miles, on a grade of eighty
feel to the mile overcoming 700 feet.
We do not leave our drawing-mom
car until Ciimaliar is reached. The
ride through this Interesting valley,
hounded by mountains, is mi appro
priate prelude to what follows in the
park Itself. It Is called a park. Your
minds shuliM be disabused of a mis
conception. It has nothing such as an
ordinary park would Indicate. No
gravelled walks no velvety lawns, no
statuary, no (lower beds, etc., but all
this extensive area Is literally crowded
with natural curiosities of the most
wonderful character. The hotels and
the government roads and bridges are
the only artificial things to be found
here, everything else being In Its nat
ural condition, rude, stein and wild.
Three miles from Livingston, . the
railroad passes through the first "can
yon of the Yellowstone," which forms

lowstone valley. This canyon Is about
u mile long and Just wide enough to
comfortably admit the read und river,
the mountain walls rising 2,000 feet
perpendicularly on either side. Pass

Paradise valley, which Is from seven
to twelve miles wide and extends some
thirty miles along the Yellowstone river
which tumbles anil pounds continuous
ly, clear as crystal and cold as Ice.
This valley lias been settled by ranch
men. The land Is very fertile nnd Irri
gation has been carried on to a high
state of perfection, making the valley
as productive as the corn belt of Illi

like great Persian rugs with their har

not the district In which one wishes to
specify and particularize. As the train
moves southward, the mountain scen
ery is ever changing and picturesque.
The most prominent peak Is Emigrant,
In the south end of the valley, which
rises proudly a mile anil a quarter
above tho valley to an elevation
of Hi.fi29 feet. Forty miles fronr Liv

canyon of the Yellowstone," called
"Y'linkee Jim Canyon," named for an
enterprising Yankee, who, prior to
bulldliifr the railroad, built a wagon
road through the canyon at great ex
pense and enjoyed a lucrative business
In collecting toll from each visitor to
the park. Yankee Jim Is still located
here and has many piscatorial guests
during the tourist season, who tind the

which the river Is compressed. is scarce

beds nearly a half mile hlh. Kxtctuling
from the bnsq, to the summit, Is n red
dish band of arenaceous clay about 100

the name of the mountain. "The Devil's

of trap-rock some l.'iO feet apart, which
precipitates 2,tHio feet down a mountain

President May Have to Use Them
in Yellowstone Park.
Probably no one has ever seen a President of
faese United States Sticking head first ma
Vowl.ank. thrown there by a tricky pair of skis.
Most President* have kept .way from «.o«
banks, and the thought of mixing up with sk.s
never entered their heads.
The soldiers who will guide and [Presi
de Roosevelt through Yellowstone Park when
he reaches that interesting portion of Ins com-
Vg Western trip may witness such a phenome
ii o n The snow in the park is from sixteen to
eighteen feet deep in many places, and the
President will surely have to take to sk.s if he
frets anywhere. He is not exactly a snowshoe
amateur, however, and the chances are very
uoh in favor of some one else taking the
\ aders while the Chief Kxecutive leads the van.
From Mammoth Hot Springs to the Golden
Gate a distance of five miles, there is a broken
trail and the party can ride on horseback. Be
yond that point the park, with its white cover
ing will seem almost as primeval as it did to
John Colter or "Jim" Badger, the first white
men to enter that wonderland of nature. April
is one of the eight or nine months in which the
park Is snowed in and the ordinary tourist
snowed out. In May th- stage roads thaw out,
and for three months there are visitors every
where.
Winter used to be the time of game harvest
for Wyoming hunters until the government de
cided to protect the game by keeping a com
pany of soldiers on the reservation the year
round. It still is the hunting season for the
lawless "bad men" who have taken refuge in
the Jackson's Hole Country, which is on the
edge of the park.
The President is going hunting for game, but
not that ho may add to his large score of centre
Bhots and things killed. Instead of a gun he
will be hunting with the naturalist, John Bur
roughs. There is no better season for seeing
the wild game with which the park abounds.

ize that he will enjoy every minute of his trip

He learned to use snowshi es in the Maine woods
before he entered politics, and his skill with skis
was acquired while ranching in the Had Lauds.
Here is the story <f his » rst winter hunting
as he has written it in one of his books:
••l enjoyed the trip, for the northland woods
are very beautiful and strange in winter, as
indeed they are at all other times- and it was
my first experience on snowshoes. I used the
ordinary wcaved racquets, and as the snow,
though very deep, was only imperfectly crusted,
I found that for a beginner the exercise was
laborious in the extreme, speedily discovering
that, no matter how cold it was, while walking

pleasantly invigorating, and not particularly laborious. __
through the wilderness woods I stood in no need
of warm clothing. But at night, especially ween
lying out, the cold was bitter.
"Our plan was to drive in a sleigh to some
logging camp, where we were always received
with hearty hospitality, and thence make hunt
ing trips, in very light marching order, through
the heart of the surrounding forest. The woods,
wrapped in their heavy white mantle; were still
and lifeless. There were a few chickadees and
woodpeckers; now and then we saw flocks Of
red polls, pine linnets an.l large, rosy gros
beaks; and once or twice I came across a
grouse or white rabbit and killed it for supper;
but this was nearly all. Yet, though bird life
was scarce, and though we saw but few beasts
beyond an occasional porcupine or squirrel,
every morning the snow was dotted with a net
work of trails made during the hours of dark
ness: the fine tracery of the footprints of the
little woodmouse, the marks which showed
the loping progress of the sable, the V and dot
of the rabbit, the round pads of the lucivee, and
many others. The snow reveals, as nothing else
does, the presence in the forest of the many shy
woodland creatures which lead their lives
abroad only after nightfall.
"Once we saw :i "coon out early after its win
ter nap, ami, following, I shot it in ■ hollow
tree. Another time we fame upon a deer, and
the frightened beast left its "yard," a taagsl of
beaten paths or deep furrows. The poor ani
mal made but slow headway through the pow
dery snow. After going thirty or forty rods it
sank exhausted in a deep drift, and '.ay there in
helpless panic as bjc walked .lose by. Wry
different were the aftions of the only caribou
we saw— a fim- beast, that had shfd its antlers.
I merely caught ■ tilimpse of it as it leaped over
a breastwork of down Umbers, ami we nmi
saw it again. Alternately trotting and miking
a succession of lung jumps, it ■peeaYlj left us
far behind; with its great splay hoof* it could
snowshoe better than we could. It si among
deer the true denizen of the regions of heavy
snowfall; far more so than the moose. Only
under exceptional conditions of crust formalin
is it in any danger from a man on snowshoes."
In another chapter of "The Wilderness Hunt
er" President Roosevelt tells how he and ether
hunters "crust" for moose si the very Rocky
Mountain country which he is about to visit:
■• 'Crusting,* or following game on snowshoea,
is, as the name implies, almost always prac
tised after the middle of February, when the
thaw begins and the snow crusts on tip. The
conditions for success in era* ■- moose and
deer are very different. A crust through which
a moose would break at every stride may tarry
a running deer without mishap, while th- former
animal would trot at ease through drifts in
which the latter would be caught as if in a
quicksand.
"If the snow is less deep or the
heavy, the moose may travt-1 for s

HE polar regions are hardly
less accessible than the Yel
lowtone National park
the greatest playground ol
the American people U in
winter. This Is scarcely
conceivable, for In summer
40,000 visitors now find It
one of the easiest placea to
Teach and to travel through.
Lieut. Frederick Schwatka made an
attempt to explore the park in Jan
uary nearly 25 years ago. He had re
turned not long before from an expe
dition in search of Sir John Frank
lin's party that had perished in the
arctic regions. Before that he had
been on a 3,000-mlle sledge journey In
the frozen north and had suffered ter
rible hardships. On his trip into the
Yellowstone Park Lieutenant Schwat
ka was accompanied by a large, well
organized party. They "traveled" on
Norwegian jkls and Canadian web
' enowBhoes; but the" Snow"" as so light
that it would not support them, and
their toboggans were exceedingly dif
ficult to draw. It took them three
days to cover 20 miles. Lieutenant
Schwatka, inured as he was to such
hardships, fell ill and was unable to
proceed. He and all the rest of the
party but four of the sturdiest men
turned back. The photographer. F.
J. Haynes; Edward Wilson, a govern
ment scout, and two others kept on.
.It took them 29 days to make the cir
cuit of the park, 200 miles. The ther
mometer ranged between 40 and 50
degrees below zero most of the time,
and the adventure nearly cost them
their lives.
Winter Population of the Playground.
The total winter population of the
park is usually between four and five
hundred people. These Include three
troops of cavalry. The cavalry can
use their horses only during the sum
mer months. During the winter they
are stabled at Fort Yellowstone. The
stage horses are driven down to the
lowlands, miles away, when the tour
ist season is over, and graze In the
sheltered valleys there until the
nows melt
In the great hotels that are
thronged during the tourist season
live only the caretakers, generally
two in each place. a man and his
wife. The first blizzard Isolates from
the world outside everybody in this
great national domain that has an
area of 3,312 square miles. No valley
within its limit has an elevation of
less than 6.000 feet, while many of
the mountain peaks within and near'
the park rise from 10,000 to 14,000
feet above sea level. Yellowstone lake

body of water In America at that alti
tude, 7,741 feet above the sea. On

though they were penned In by the
polar ice. Of course the telephone
and the telegraph bring them scraps
of news from the outer world, but the
only way of getting about is on
snowshoes or skis. Even then the
distances between the places where
the people live are so great and the
ways so dangerous that few venture
forth. Only the government scouts,
whose duty It is to look after the
wild life In the park aftd see that It
is not molested by poachers, get out
at all. The rest of the people there
are like the bearsthey hibernate
until spring. An ample supply of fuel
and provisions is laid in before the
first snowstorms begin to sweep over
the Continental divide, and there is
little to do until the sun swings
northward and the snows melt.
Building a Hotel Amid Arctic Tem-
r.-'i
-r peraturj,
Despite the arctic rigors of this re
gion, however, 2T0 men have boen
fighting the cold there thU winter
completing tho fifth of the big hotels
that are. the halting places of tour
ists In this summer playground that
belonxa to the iople of the United
States. The lirst order prepared on
the kitchen ranges of this new hos
telry which stands on the brink of
the great precipice down which roars
emTlessly the mlghty cataract of the
Yellowstone, was for nails. Nails big
and little, brads and spikes, ten-pen
nies and shingles, had to be heated
on the cookstoves before the carpen
ters could handle them. The reason
for this baste was that the new hotel
had to be finished In time for the
summer season, when the park is In
its brief period of verdant glory.
More people will go to the Yellow
stone National Park this year than
ever before. In 182, when the fed
eral government dedicated It "as a
public park or pleasure ground for
the benefit and enjoyment of the peo
ple," probably not more than a thou
sand persons a year were visiting It
In the next twenty-three years the
number of visitors climbed slowly to
about 6,000 annually. In 1895, the au
thorities began counting the persons
who entered the park, and complete
records have been kept ever since.
There were 5,438 visitors in 1895.
Ten years later the number had risen
to 26,188. In 1904, it dropped to
17,172. The next year it fell off near
ly a thousand. In 1908 the total was
18,748. Then came the most remark
able increase in visitors that the park
has ever known. In 1909 there were
nearly twic as many (32,545) as the
y'ear before This was principally
due to the opening of a new railroad
gateway to the park at Yellowstone,
Mont. which made it much easier of
access.
A Bit of E. H. Harrlman's Wizardry.
This came about through a visit
that the late E. H- Harrlman made to
the park in the summer of 1904. He
was so Impressed by the wonders of
the park that be immediately ordered
the location and construction of a
branch from the Oregon Short Line,
a part of the Union Pacific system, to
the western border of the park. This
road, from Idaho Falls to Yellow
stone, Montana, 20 miles from the
lower 0yser basin, was finished No
vember 12, 1907, and was opned for
traffic the following June. It Is 107
miles long and cost nearly $2,000,000.
Its construction called Into play the
greatest energy and skill In the sci
ence of railroad building.
Owing to the deep snows and severe
winters work could be carried on dur
ing only about four months of the
''4-. ; ;
year, nut In that brief season, a vast
"iny of men and machines tollou
night and day." The giant mountain
barriers with tl.elr dr-p valleys in be
tween had to be conquered. That part
of the earth whero the rails ran had
to be remodeled so as to secure the
safest and easiest grades. Probably
no railway, where so many obstacles
had to be overcome, ever was built
in so short a time. Hut the largely In
creased number of visitors to the
park has proved that the new line is
fully appreciated. Of the more than
40,000 who entered the park last
yeur nearly half went by this new
western gateway that Mr. Harrlman
created.
The government scouts who are
guardians of the wild creatures are
about the only ones who ever see
much of the winter beauties of the
park. Those who have been there
any length of time have learned much
that Is new about the habits of the
animals that abound there, although
they are chiefly concerned In keeping
poachers out of the park. There are
fewer of these now than there used
to be, because heavier penalties have
been laid by the government on those
who are caught.
The few that do venture in the park
mostly come In winter. Then there is
less chance of being detected, but
more risk of losing their lives In the
cold and snow. One thing more than
all others tempts them the buffalo.
Unscrupulous taxidermists will pay
the weight In silver for a buffalo head
nowadays, for these heads are prac
tically unattainable by legitimate
means. The rest of the wild creatures
that make their homes in the park are
seldom molested.
P.oachlng in the Deep Snow.
It has been 17 years since one of
these poachers after buffalo has been
caught, but he did so much damage
before he was arrested that it has
taken a long time to make up for it.
Early in March, 1894, a party was
organized at Fort Yellowstone for
the purpose of visiting the winter
ranges of the game to ascertain the
exact number of buffalo that still ex
isted and to photograph them. The

party traveled on Norwegian snow
shoes, with packs of sleeping bags,
provisions and camera, direc'ly to
Hayden valley via Norris and the
Grand canyon. They found 81 buf
falo in the valley, together with nu
merous small groups of elk aggregat
ing more than 300.
In a secluded spot toward the end of
the second day's march they discov
ered the cache of a poacher. They
were much surprised at this, as they
had had no idea that there was any
one in the park killing game. Ths
cache consisted of a canvas tepee,
sleeping bag, provisions and tobog
gan, and they found six buffalo heads
suspended in a tree nearby. A trace
of fire in thei tepee led the scouts to
believe that the poacher was not far
away. To capture him was the next
move. It had been snowing constant
ly all the morning, and all the snow
shoe tracks leading from camp were
entirely obliterated. The scouts sep
arated and went in different direc
tions. When five miles from camp one of
tbera heard a half dozen rifle shots in
rapid succession. Hastening through
the timber in that direction, he came
upon an opening In the forest and saw
the poacher. He had driven six of the
buffalo Into the deep snow and had
slaughtered the entire band. Ths scout
was alone and armed only with a re
volver. Poachers of this kind are des
perate men. They know that the arm
of the federal government Is long and
Its grip sura ones it seizes them.
Therefore tbey fight to the last No
desperado Is more reckless of his life.
The scout knew this, but did not hes
itate for a moment It was still snow
ing hard, and neither the poacher nor
his dog noticed the scout's approach.
The scout was within 20 feet of the
poacher and had him covered with blB
revolver before he told him to throw
up his hands. A moment more, and
w; . ' tvv ' k )
he was disarmed. Theri he was hand
cuffed and takeu to the guardhouse
at Fort Yellowstone. He had killed
about onc-elhth of all (tie buffalo In
the park.
Elks and Dears Very Comfortable In
the "Big Cold."
There are about 250 buffalo in tho
park now. To protect them more ef
fectually against poachers about 20U
are kept In an liuiosure and have be
come partly domesticated. The re
mainder run wild in the country to
th; cast of the Yellowstone lake.
Fully 5,(100 elk winter In the foot
hills of Mount Washburn, on Speci
men ridge, along the east folk of the
Yellowstone and along the main

1,000 feet in diameter, where they
keep the Bnow trodden down. The
bull elks patrol these "yards" at night
so as to keep away the mountain
lloriB and other animals that prey
upon them.
The elks shed their horns about the
flrBt of March, and until they grow out
again lead a quiet life so that their
sprouting horns will not be Injured.
At the time when they shed their"
horns they are still herded together,
and now and then a Bcout will run
across some secluded spot in the pri
meval wilderness where the ground is
covered with two or three score of
these great antlers, some of them six
or seven feet long. They are allowed
to remain where they are, for it is not
permitted to take them from the park
or even to use them for decorative
purposes there. Hut before the end
of the next winter they disappear. The
field mice and other small rodents eat
them.
The bears that are seen around the
hotels In the summer time, stealing
garbage or fighting the searchlight
when it is turned on them at night, go
into winter quarters in November or
December snd sleep until spring.
There are hundreds, of them, black,
brown and grizzly. They go into
caves or hollow logs or under the
roots of trees that the snow will
v V 1 "i J
eovt?-. There are many natural cavei
in the park. Sometimes four or five
bears will snuggle up to each other ir
the same cave and sleep the winter
away. It Is In winter, too, that the
cubs are born. When the baby bear
comes into the world he Is not much
bigger than a rat, but be grows and
grows In his cave, kept warm by his
mother until spring. When he emerges
into the light he is a full grown cub,
quite able to take care of himself and
fight anything of his size.
A Paradise for Wild Things.
Millions of trout come up into the
smaller streams to spawn In the
spring. Hears live mostly on berries
and fish, when they can get them.
Since there are no berries in the
spring the bears break their fast on
fish. They wade into the creeks and
scoop them out with their paws. When
the little bears get tired of catching
fish In the shallow pools they go hunt
ing for moles and work as industrious
ly as puppy dogs digging them out of
tho earth. Springtime, when the
bears are lean and hungry, is their
busiest time
Three-fourths of the park Is a dense
forest, a primeval wilderness. Away
from the few hotels, the roads and
the trails the park today is what It
was before even a Pharaoh reigned In
Egypt It is such a paradise for the
wild things' that roam at will there
that they have lees to fear, even from
each other and from the elements,
than anywhere else in the wilderness.
When the fury of the winter storms
drives the tlk, deer, mountain sheep
and antelope Into the sheltered val
leys and canyons they have nothing

In this region, nearly 8,000 feet
above the Bea, where tho mercury
sinks away below zero from Hecem

the summer tourist ever nets a hint
of. Civilization is miles away across j
a wilderness of shining, snowclad
mountains. The gale-driven snow
dances over this waste and is piled
into fantastic drifts. Sometimes It is
swept with a roar through the miAin
tain gorges faster than the swiftest
railway train ever traveled. It covers
to the eaves some of the big hotels.

huge gash in Uie earth whose walls
glow with every tint of Jewels and

where here and there the winds have

rocks exposed. Their reds

glow the brighter in contrast with the
surrounding whiteness. The black fo

Where the water slides over the preci

carded wool. Down at the bottom of
the gorge, where the waters are swift

at the base of the falls.
The great geysers play endlessly,

no one Is there to see them. Every sev

is, there would be as great an influx of
visitors between the 15th of June,
when the season beginH, and the 15tl
of September, when It end.s, us now
nail away to Europe for rest and play.
To get to the new gateway to this
wonderland by the most direct route
the traveler branches off from the
"'-ln Uno of the Union Pacific at Og-
den, Utah. A night's ride In a Pull
man lands him at Yellowstone station,
the western entrance of tho park,
ready for the 158 mile tour in the
Monlda and Yellowstone stages that
are awaiting him. The trip through
the park may be made In five days,
or it may be cut down to two by vis
iting the region of tho geysers alone.
Many, Many Wonderful Things.
There are many wonderful things
on the road before one gets to the
Yellowstone park, however. Going
west from Ogden on the Union Pa
cific is one of the most stupendous
pieces of railway engineering In 'the
world, the great Salt Lal;o cut-off that
was constructed at a cost of $6,000.
000 to save forty-three miles of the
distance between Ogden and 8an
Francisco. It crosses the Great Salt
lake at its deepest portion and is
102 miles long. Soms of the best
engineers in the world pronounced
this cut-off Impossible, but it was
built and is one of the unique fea
tures of American railroading.
Another thing that attracts trav
elers is Salt Lake City itself, which
has been constantly in the public eye
ever since it was a little huddle of
wagons in the wilderness more than
three generations ago. In many ways
it Is one of the most remarkable
cities in the world, and as the seat
l of power of the religious empire of
the Mormons It Is unique. The Taber
nacle, with Its great organ, the big
gest in the world, and the other nota
ble buildings have been described
over and over again, but no words or
photographs can picture them ade
quately any more than they can a
bath in the lake Itself In water In
which one cannot sink.
To get to the Yellowstone National
park or to Salt Lake City Is now one
of the easiest things imaginable. The
directions are simple: You go to Cg
den by the Union Pacific, the new
and direct route, turn to tho north
for the park and to the south for the
"City of the Saints."
The "First Man on the Ground."
It is just a hundred and four years
since the Yellowstone territory was
discovered. A trapper and hunter
found it. He was one John Colter, a
private of the famous Lewis and Clark
' expedition. When, in 1806, this dis-
' tlnguiehed band of pioneers retraced
1 tnir K,ePs and 6taftel back to St.
j Ixula over thf'lr route that eventually
"v f'1"1 ......
broke aw-ay. All by himself, he set
out for tho headwaters of the Mis
souri. He w-as practically forgotten
when, four years later, he came into
St. Louis, tattered, torn, Indian-like
in bis ways, but bubbling over with.
i enthusiasm.
He had seen the most wonderful
place in the world, ho said, where
steam came out of the earth and
scalding water leaped miles high,
whero there were diabolical furnaces
under ground. It would have been
the "abode of the damned," he said,
but for the fact that there was no-
sign, for hundreds of miles, of human
beings. Surrounded by tho curious,
John Colter talked for days of the
wonders he had seen. And he met
with the fate of many; no one be
lieved him.

IHE FAME of Yellowstone Park
m has been so Indelibly associated
wllh Its wonderful geysers that
few persons know that It Is the
only spot in tho United States where
tho public can see in largo numbers
tho animals of the forests and wilds In
their natural state. In reality It Is
tho most successful wild animal pre
serve In the world.
Only those who personally know
tho West appreciate tho changes that
havo taken place. In Its animal life In
the past forty years. Thirty years
ago elk and antelope existed In la'rgo
numbers in tho Rockies from Mexico
to Canada, but these .animals were
killed with no thought that they might
ultimately bo extinguished. It was
fortunate that when tho Yollowstono
National Park was established, In
1S72, It occurred to somo public mind.
2d Individuals that Its 54 by C3 square?
miles would mako a wonderful game
preserve. As a result there are enough
animals now In this park, to bo of
rreat Interest and In ycara to come It
may form an epltomo of conditions In
tho wilderness that once existed In
many places In tho West.
Thousands Or Animals
There aro six hundred antelope, a
thousand- or more of deer, more than
five hundred moose, four hundred buf
faloes, two hundred mountain sheep,
any number of black and grizzly bears,
and more than thirty thousand elk.
that mako Yellowstone Park their
homo under Government protection.
Those animal herds uro now being
used ns nucleus herds for other parks
national. State and city and for
zoological gardens, when Government
permits. In recent years many of the
animals particularly the elk. bears and
bison have been quietly taken captive
and shipped away to various parts of
the country.
In early days buffaloes existed in
large numbers In tho AY est and ranged
from the Middle West to the Rockies.
Now the only place whero thoy arc
found In their original habitat Is the
Yellowstone Park. The pronged horn
antelope apd a large variety of moose
found near Yellowstone Lako are oth
er Interesting park animals.
Animals Fed In Winter
Though most persons see the ani
mals of the Ycll6wstone In summer
thero arc certain enthusiastic nulmal
lovers who go to this remarkable Park
In winter that they may sec them as
they como to Gardiner, the entrance
to tho Park to get tho alfalfa hay
which the Government harvests each
yoar for winter food for tho Park
animals. Though In summer all kinds
of animals roam In the higher parts
, of tho Park, tho winters are so scvero
that they arc glad to como down to
get food. So nt Gardiner, one can seo
tho graceful deer, hundreds of striped
antelopes, dozens of big horn sheep
and thousands of elks who ramblo
about, feed, and do not seem timid at
all. Early in the morning tho big
hay wagon starts out from Mammoth
Hot Springs, near Fort Yellowstone,
and carries alfalfa to Gardiner, and
as soon as It approaches tho elk and
antelope begin to appear. Sometimes
they como In stately tile, with every
appearance of a stylish dinner party,
and at other times they mess together
in groups of hundreds. Or thoy stand
In line ar.d wait patiently until the
wagon starts on its rounds of scatter
ing feed They never puch each other,
never quarrel, and pay no attention lo
sightseers or photographers, though
when thoy finish eating they stand and
look at tho onlookers reflectively' and
perhaps tho deer kick up their -heola
and run In sheer playfulness. As tho
Park lsrsurrounded.by four national
forests the question of whether part
of their area could bo used for graz
ing has been discussed, but the diffi
culty of adequate protection has been
thq main trouble.
Bears Arc Very Tamo
In summer tho wild aplmals vlo In
Interest with the geysers and most
tourists revurn, with Interesting benr
stories. At meal tlmo bears venturo
near tho hotels to get the garbage and
they aro sometimes soen in other
places. Back In the woods, dwell Mr.
and Mrs. Bruin, and their progeny,
but they havo learned whero garbage
titbits can bo found and on their dally
excursions to get this food thoy arc
a source of enjoyment to lookers-on.
Seats aro oroctcd a short dlstanco
from tho hotels at tho edgo of the
woctl3, and here ono may sit and
watch Bruin cat his supper. As he
comes down from his forest home, ac
companied by various members of his
family, Mr, Bear, whether ho bo cln- j
napion, black or silver tipped pays
no attention to his audience- He is
out for a good meal and ho gets it
undisturbed by such harrowing prob
lems as conservation, Hooverlzatlon
and the like. A soldier stands guard
for fear of somo accident for though
It is said the henry of Yellowstone
Park arc harmlces and a few have
learned to cat out of some Intrepid
persons hands, they nre" wild bears
still. Tourists always enjoy taking
their pictures and around Old Faith
ful, and tho Canyon they seem quite
domesticated. It took years for these
bears to learn that the people In the
Park were their friends, but they bear
evidonco of good treatment in their
sleek coats and fat bodies.
Every year tho beautiful deer are
soen along the roadways and near tho
hotels. During tho fall, winter and
I spring they arc a familiar fcaturo or.
tho parade ground at Fort Yellow
stone and they seem loss timid than
the elk, which aro apt to seclude them
selves In the valleys and timber. But
a short ride from tho hotels will
usually bring a herd in view especial
ly in the vicinity of Shoshomc Lake
and Haydcn Valley. By some marvel
the animals Deem to adapt themselves
to tho automobiles that now take the
place of tho Park coaches. As one
skims along In theso cars thero are
certain retired portions of tho Pak
where one can seo the beavers at work.
They seem to be rapidly multiplying
though many have been shipped to
city parks or approved preserves. At
Yancey's thero aro many colonics of
these beavers Inthe brooks and they
can be seen cutting down trees, swim
ming, laying in their winter food and
doing all sorts of chores as they frisk
about their dams, .houses and slides.
Fishing Paradise
Of course, the fisherman gets his fill
In this Park, whore tho waters have
been "planted" annually over since
1S91. It Is great fun to go fishing
In tho lako or streams and catch the
Loch Levin, rainbow or brook trout.

        <text>he oldest and blg
• gest of our national
parks, the first national
park to he established In
the world, the largest and
finest geyser basin on
earth and the most famous of big
game preserves, will probably receive
b largo addition of territory to the
A°uth from the Sixty-sixth congress.
A bill for this addition was Introduced
In the lust congress, was passed by
the house and was shelved In the sen
Bte tn the confusion of the lust days of
the Inst session.
Yellowstone has n most romantic his
tory. It was discovered In 1807 by
lohn Colter. We bought the Louisi
ana territory—the land between the
Mississippi and the Rockies—of Nu
poleon In 1802, without knowing any
thing about this garden spot of the
world. The Lewis and Clark expedi
tion of 1804-8, whlèh made the round
trip from St. Louis to the tuouth of the
Columbia river to find out what we
bad bought, passed within n few miles
of the north end of the park without
•vcn suspecting Its existence. Colter
was one of the party and secured his
discharge before reaching St. Louis to
turn back and trap beaver. Colter re
turned to St. Louis in 1810. The pub
lic laughed nt his story and derisively
dubbed this geyser land "Colter's
Hell." Only one man believed him—
his old commander, Capt. William
Clark, who put .Ills 1807 route on the
•fflclat mnp, of the expedition.
In the '20s James Bridger, the fa
mous plainsman, rediscovered "Col
ter's Hell" and told of Its wonders.
But Bridger was a genius in telling
"tall yarns"—his obsidian cliff, and
hot spring stories ure classics In the
West to this day. "Just another of
Jim Brldger's yarns" was the popular
verdict. Prospectors who flocked to
the region during various gold excite
ments dlscnvcrjgd the Yellowstone the
third time. But It was not until 1870
that the country believed In "Colter's j
Hell." Then there was popular enthu- !
slasm and In 1872 the Yellowstone was
aet a-dde by act of congress ns a na- !
tlonnl park—a nubile playground for
the people of the United Stutes for
ever.
Millions In Improvements.
Paring the first 14 years of its ex
totenee as a national park Yellowstone
was administered by civilian superin- !
tendent* good, bad and Indifferent, j
Congress sometimes appropriated
funds for the park and often did not.
By 1880 conditions were so bad In the
park and poachers were killing off the
big game so fast that the management
was turned over to the army. The |
army record was excellent. With the
creation of the national park service,
two yenrs ago, exclusive control Is now
In this new bureau of the Interior de
partment, which Is charged with ad
ministration of all nationnl parks.
On the whole, congress has been fair
ly liberal In appropriations. These to

are 278 miles of main and 25 miles of
secondary road and nearly 400 miles
of fairly well-marked trails. Fifteen
ranger stations nre maintained; these
are connected with headquarters near
the north entrance by 270 miles of tel

The best meat to eat In cold weuth

An official estimate of the forest

During the war nearly 14,000,000

The park lies principally In the
northwest corner of Wyoming, hut laps
over a little Into Idaho and Montana.
Us area is about 3,343 squares miles
or 2,142,720 acres. Its altitude Is 0,
000 to 11,000 feet. There nre four
entrances : Gardiner on the north ;
Cody on the east ; Moran on the south,
and Yellowstone on the west. All ex
cept Moran are railroad points. In
1018 the travel by entrance wns:
North, 7,504 ; east, 4,401 ; south. 542 ;
west, 8,702.
Tourist travel goes over n belt road
which forms two large loops, resembles
a- figure 8 and covers the scenic fea
tures of the north two-thirds of the
park. Three-flftlis of the tourist travel
is by private automobile and the pro
portion Is growing larger each yenr.
Yellowstone Lacke Scenery.
This, then Is the lay of the land.
Yellowstone Is'by far the biggest of
the 18 national parks and Is the best
developed. Its geysers nre us unique
ns the big trees of Sequoia, the lake
of Crater Lnke and the canon of Grand
Canon. Why. then should It he en
larged by the addition of territory to
the south approximately equal to one
third of Its present area?
The comprehensive answer Is: The
Yellowstone Is too small. The natural
question, then, Is, Why Is the Yellow
stone too small ? There are several an
swers, Including these three:
Becnuse It lacks scenery.
Because the region to the south Is a
natural part of the park.
Because the elk to the south are tn
danger of extinction.
Yellowstone does lack scenery of the
majestic kind. Its peaks nre not lofty
and rise from a high plateau. Its gey
sers, hot springs, paint pots, etc., are
freak scenery. In short, the Yellow
stone does not hold the tourist. In the
days of the stage coach It took the
tourist about live days to see the Yel
lowstone ; then he was ready to leave.
Now the automobile has cut his stay
in half. And he Is not likely to re
turn. In strong contrast nre such
parks ns Rocky Mountain and Yosemlte.
There the average stay Is at least two
weeks, while many thousands go regu
larly every season, stay a month or
more and look upon the park ns their
summer home.
The offlclui attendance flgures tell
the story: Yellowstone, last four sea
sons, 51,895; 35,849 ; 35,400 ; 21,275;
Rocky Mountain, 31,000 ; 51,000; 117,
188; 101,497. The 1918 decrease In
both parks was due to war-time condi
tions; Increase In railroad fares and
government discouragement of pleas
ure travel. The travel by private au
tomobile held Its own. The hotels in
Yellowstone were not open.
The nationnl park service would
change the Yellowstone conditions and
would begin by enlarging the park.
In addition It has extensive plans for
making the Yellowstone attractive.
These Include golf, tennis, improved
fishing, model automobile camps, new

The territory to be added contains
approximately a thousand square miles
end is known to big game hunters as
the Jackson Hole country. It contains
the sort of scenery that Yellowstone
lacks. The Absaroka Itnnge along the
east boundary contains several lofty
peaks and Younts Peak runs up to 12,
185 feet. The west slope of this range
contains the headwaters of the Yel
lowstone river. The south boundary
runs along Buffalo fork to the Snake
river at Jackson lake. The west line
runs nlong the Teton range. Included
In the addition are Jackson lake.
Grand Teton (13,741) and Mount Mo
ran (12,100). Grand Teton has been
a famous landmark since the early
days of the fur trade and Jackson
Hole was the last refuge of organized
bad men, cattle rustlers and horse
' ' ~ '
thieves. It wns unknown land when
Yellowstone was established In 1872.
The Jnckson Hole elk herd Is an en
tirely different herd from that of Yel
lowstone. It Is supposed to number
about 15,000 head. As nntlonnl parks
upon establishment automatically be
come wild animal life sanctuaries, en
largement of Yellowstone would save
the herd.
The uddition of the Jackson Hole
country will work many changes In
Yellowstone. A planned feature Is an
automobile liighwuy from Moran to the
Cody road, around the east side of
Yellowstone lake, thus making a third
loop. A hotel will be established on
this loop north of Jnckson lnke. The
south entrance will be developed. The
automobile litghwnys to Victor nnd
Lander, both rnllrond points, will he
Improved. Improved hlgliwny connec
tion with the Lincoln Highway will
be made to accommodate private au

to the south entrance will give It at
lenst Its full share of travel. The
south entrance route Is the shortest
between Rocky Mountain nnd Yellow
stone. Presumably automobile camp
ers will And the addition the most de
sirable part of the park.
The fame of Yellowstone National
park has spread over all the enrth and
its Influence 1ms been world wide. The
world saw In It a new thing In civili
zation—the establishment of a public
playground In perpetuity for the peo
ple of n nation. The world found It
good nnd the example has heen fol

nier? If so, be sure to take with
you Uncle Sam's 1020 bulletin, just
off the government press. It tells
you all about "Colter's Hell"
which is to say, the Yellowstone,
oldest and most famous of our 19
national parks.
Why "Colter's Hell"? Well, It's
an interesting story and not every
one knows it. The story of John Colter and "Col
ter's llell" properly begins away back In 180o,
when Thomas Jefferson, our third president,
bought the Louisiana territory from Napoleon
Bonavmrte.
The western boundary of the United States
was then the Mississippi, as fixed by the treaty
with Great Britain after the Involution. Jeffer
son sent James Monroe to France to co-oirerate
with Minister Robert It. Livingston in the pur
chase of the Mississippi's mouth for $2,000,XH).'
Napoleon laughed at them, lie had just made
Spain cede him the Louisiana Territory, Intend
ing to establish there an empire to replace that
lost to the British In Canada. Then Napoleon saw
be must fight the British. He could not fight and
colonize, too. So, to spite the British, he told the
two Americans they could have all the country
between the Mississippi and the Itockies (Texas
not included) for $15,(XK),000. And he made Mon
roe and Livingston agree. Jefferson was scared
stiff at the act of his agents. There was a nation
wide rumpus over the purchase, but congress rati
fied it and the people finally approved it.
Jefferson had not the slightest idea what the
United States had bought and in the spring of 1S04
ho started the Lewis and Clark expedition from St.
Louis to find out Tills famous expedition went to
the mouth of the Columbia river and returned to
St. Louis in lSOG, after having been given, up for
lost. It passed a few miles to the north of the
Yellowstone, without even suspecting its existence.
John Colter was one of the private soldiers of
the exiedltioii. Before it reached St. Louis he got
his discharge and returned with two trappers to
the headwaters of the Missouri for beaver. In the
firing of 1S07 at the mouth of the Platte be met

Fort Lisa at the confluence of tlfe Yellowstone and
the Big Horn. Colter, going alone to summon the
Crows lo (lie fort for trade, passed to the south of
tlie Yellowstone tltrough Jackson's Hole to Tierre's
Hole at the west of the Yellowstone. Returning
thence to Fort Lisa, he passed diagonally through
the Yellowstone, the first white man to see its won
ders. Colter, after adventures and travels that give
him a front rank among explorers of the west, re
turned to St. Louis in 1S10. lie recounted his ad
ventures and lie told of the marvels of the Yellow
stone. St. Louis believed some of his tales of ad
venture, but would have none of the geysers, boil
ing springs and paint-pots of the Yellowstone.
They derisively dubbed it "Colter's Hell," laughed
over it for a time and then forgot it. Gen. Wil
liam Clark, his commander, was the only one to
believe him. On the oflicial map of the Lewis and
Clark expedition Is a dotted line from Fort Lisa
to the Yellowstone and return, with the legend,
"Colter's route in 1807."
The Yellowstone v'as discovered the second
time about 1S27 this time by Jim Bridger, one of
(Jen. William 11. Ashley's lieutenants In the Rocky
Mountain Fur company. Bridger was the discov
erer of Great Salt Lake, a map-maker without an
equal, a mountaineer, plainsman and guide with
no superior. But he had a hobby big yarns. It
is he who made up those classic "whoppers" of
the west the obsidian cliff, boiling spring, echo
and alum creek stories. So, when he told about
the wonders of the Yellowstone, u scoffing frontier
said, with laughter: "Oh, just another of Jim
Bridgor's yarns."
Warren Angus Fenis described the Upper Gey
ser basin of the Yellowstone in 1S-12 and was not
believed. Prospectors in the Montana gold excite
ment of 1802 again described the Yellowstone; they
were set down as liars. Newspapers and maga
zines would not publish the stories; lecturers were
stoned. Iu 1809 the semi-official Montana Wash-burn-Langford
expedition did succeed in getting a
hearing. In 1870 the federal government sent an
official exjied It ion which official ly put Mie Yellow
stone on the map.
Cornelius Hedges, September 18, 1S70, by a
campflre In the Yellowstone, proposed that the
wonderland be niado a national park a pluy-
ground set aside for the people's use forever. The
idea took. Congress established the Yellowstone
National park, March 1, 1872.
The establishment of the Yellowstone as a na
tional park after 05 years of "discoveries" was
the first time such a thing had been done In all
history. It was the first national park in all the
world. The United States set the example which
practically all the civilized world has followed.
Uncle Sam's 1920 Yellowstone Bulletin is a
fascinating booklet of 103 pages of text, maps
and illustrations. It contains everything that the
tourist needs to know, from how to get there to 0
time table of the geysers and from the different
kinds of trout to the automobile regulations. The
following items are taken from the introductory
pages :
The Yellowstone National park was created by
the act of March 1, 1872. It is approximately G2
miles long and 54 miles wide, giving an area of
3.348 square miles, or 2,142,720 acres. It Is under
the control and supervision of the national park
service of the Interior department.
The Yellowstone is probably the best known of
our national parks. Its geysers are celebrated the
world over because, for size, power, and variety
of action, as well as number, the region has no
competitor.
The Yellowstone National park is located in
northwestern Wyoming, encroaching slightly upon
Montana and Idaho. It is our largest national
park. The central portion Is essentially a broad,
elevated, volcanic plateau, between 7,000 and 8,500
feet above st-a level and with an average elevation
of about 8,000 feet. Surrounding ft on the south,
east, north, and northwest are mountain ranges
with culminating peaks and ridges rising from
2,000 to 4,000 feet above the general level of the
inclosed tableland.
The entire region is volcanic. Not only the sur
rounding mountains but the great interior plain
is made of material once ejected, as ash and lava,
from depths far below the surface. Geological
speculation points to a crater which doubtless once
opened just west of Mount Washburn.
There are five active geyser basins, the Norris,
the Lower, the Upper, the Heart lake, and Sho
shone basins, all lying In the wesMind south cen
tral parts of the park. The geysers exhibit a large
variety of character and action. Some, like Old
Faithful, spout at quite regular Intervals, longer
or shorter. Others are irregular. Some burst up
ward with immense power. Others shoot streams
at angles or bubble anil foam In action.
Geysers arc. roughly speaking, water volca
noes. They occur only at places where the Inter
nal heat of the earth approaches close to the sur
face. Their action, for so many years unex
plained, and even now regarded with wonder by
so many. Is simple. Water from the surface trick
ling through crack In the rocks, or water from
subterranean springs collecting in the bottom of
the geyser's crater, down among the strata of in
tense heat, becomes Itself Intensely heated and
gives off steam, which expands and forces upward
the cooler water that lies above It.
At last the water in the bottom reaches so
great an expansion under continued heat that the
less: heated water above can no longer weigh It
down, so it hursts upward with great violence,
rising many feet in the air and continuing to play
until practically all the water In the crater has
been expelled.
Nearly the entire Yellowstone region Is remark
able for its hot water phenomena. The more
prominent geysers are confined to three basins
lying near each other In the middle west side of
the park, but other hot water manifestations oc
cur nt more widely separated points. Marvelous
ly colored hot springs, mud volcanoes, and other
strange phenomena are frequent. At Mammoth,
at Norris, and at Thumb the hot water lias
lrought to the surface quantities of white min
eral deposits which build terraces of beautifully
incrusted basins high up into the air, often en
gulfing trees of considerable size. Over the edges'
of these carved basins pours the hot water. Mi
croscopic plants called algae grow on the edges
and sides of these basins, painting them hues of
red and pink and bluish gray, which glow bril
liantly. At many other points lesser hot spring
occur, introducing strange, almost uncanny, ele
ments into wooded and otherwise quite normal
landscapes.
The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone affords
a spectacle worthy of a national park were there
no geysers. Standing upon Inspiration Point,
which pushes out almost to the center of tle can
yon, one seems to look almost vertically down
upon the foaming Yellowstone river. To the south
a waterfall twice the height of Niagara rustics
seemingly out of the pine-clad hills and pours
downward to be lost again in green. From that
point two .or three miles to where you stand and
beneath you widens out the most glorious kaleido.
scope of color you will ever see in nature. The
steep slopes, dropping on either side 1,000 feet and
more from the pine-topped levels above, are incon
ceivably carved and fretted by the frost and the
erosion of the ages.
The fossil forests of the YellowstoneNatlon.il
park cover an extensive area in the northern por
tion of the park, being especially abundant along
the west side of Lamar river for about 20 miles
above its junction with the Yellowstone. One
traversing the valley of the Lamar river may see
at many places numerous upright fossil trunks in
the faces of nearly vertical walls. These trunks
are not all at a particular level hut occur at Irreg
ular heights; in fact a section cut down through
these 2,000 feet of beds would disclose a succes
sion of fossil forests. That is to say, after the
first forest grew and was entombed, there was a
time without volcanic outburst a period long
enougli to permit a second forest to grow above
the first. Tliis In turn was covered by volcanic
material and preserved, to.be followed again by a
period of quiet, and these more or less regular al
ternations of volcanlsm and forest growth contin
ued throughout the time the beds were iu process
of formation.
The Yellowstone National park Is . the largest
and most succesNful wild animal refuge In the
world. It Is also, for this reason, the best and
most accessible field for nature study. Its. 3.300
square miles of mountains and valleys remain
nearly as nature made them, for the 2HJ miles of
roads and the four hotels and many camps are as
nothing in this immense wilderness. No tree has
been cut except when absolutely necessary for
road or trail or camp. No herds Invade Its val
leys. Visitors for the most part keep to the beat
en road, and the wild animals have learned in the
years that they mean them no barm. To be sure
they are not always seen by the ioople In the
automobile stages which whirl from point to point
dally during the season; but the quiet watcher on
the trails may see deer and bear and elk and an
telope to his heart's content, and he may even see
mountain sheep, moose, and bison by journeying
on foot or by horseback into their distant retreats.
It is an excellent bird preserve also; 20U spe
cies live natural, undisturbed lives. Eagles aro
found among the crags.
Trout fishing in Yellowstone waters Is unex
celled. All three of the great watersheds abound
in trout, which often attain large size. Yellow
stone lake is. t lie home of large trout, which are
taken freely from boats, and the Yellowstone riv
er and Its tributaries yield excellent catches to the
skillful angler.
The criticism often made by persons who have
visited granite countries that the Yellowstone re
gion lacks the supreme grandeur of some others
of our national parks will cease to have weight
when the magnificent Teton mountains just south
of the soiflhern boundary are added to the park.
These mountains begin at the foot of the Pitch
stone plateau a mile or two below the southern
gateway and extend south and west. They bor
der Jackson lake on its west side, rising rapidly
in a series of remarkably toothed and Jagged peaks
until they reach a sublime climax, 30 miles south
of the park, in the Grand Teton, which rises cathedral-like
to nn altitude of 13,747 feet. ,
These amazing mountains are, from their na
ture, a component part of the Yellowstone Na
tional park, whose gamut of majestic scenery they
complete, and no doubt would have been Included
within its original boundaries had their supremo
magnificence been then appreciated. Already Yel
lowstone visitors have claimed It, and nutomohllo
stages run to Moran and back on regular schedule.
In time, no doubt, part of it will be added forumlly
to the park territory.

VERSARY OF YEL

Jim Bridger's Biggest

Yellowstone.

gigantic geysers, rivers that ran

and

came known as the grtatest liar of
his time.

A rough deal,, indeed.
But 1922 marks the golden anni
versary of the Yellowstone National
Park. And this year every traveler
who goes to the wonderland to help
ceelbrate the gala year, every deluxe
train that runs from Salt Lakt City
to the park entrance at West Yel
lowstone, will be a vindication for
poor old Bridger.
His biggest "lie" was the truth.
• There have been many changes to
the Yellowstone since Bridger's day
as travelers who come this year will
find. Where he went in overland
with pack horses, they roll in over
a steel highway in de luxe trains,
whose service this year will be
doubled. In addition to the famous
"Yellowstone Special" which nightly
flashes over the rails from Salt Lake
to the park entrance, there will be
a daylight train, which will enable
the visitor to see the scenic moun
tain wonders of the Targhee forest,
en route to the park itself.
Arriving at West Yellowstone,
more changes are evident. Where
Bridger went thru the brush, and
used river beds as trails, this sum
mer's traveler will find a matchless
system of highways, with automo
bile transportation awaiting him.
He can select any one of half a
dozen trips thru the wonderland.
Instead of mountain trails there is a
system of matchless highways.
Hotels with every modern comfort
and convenience await him in the
heart of the wilderness. Permanent
camps offer equal comfort and at
traction. But both hotels and
camps have been so skillfully con
structed that their rustic log archi
tecture adds to the natural wild
beauty of the whole.
Thru all this is a wonderful sys
tem of co-operation between gov
ernment, railroads, hotels, camps,
and transportatoin that enables
100,000 people to se the whole park
annually. And yet with all these
changes, so have they been kept to
the spirit of the place, the park is
the same old Yellowstone.
Only one change is the reverse of
what it seems it should be. The
animals, wild in Bridger's day, are
tame now.
hand.
lordly heads to watch the bus cara
vans roll by. Deer pause by the
roadside and eye them speculatively.
Mighty rainbow trout leap from the
river to tempt the anglers.
Clear and deep, the Yellowstone
river flows on, unchanged. The
voice of the falls booms forth in the
key it used when the moon was
young, the geysers spout at the
regular intervals as they did before
Columbus made his historic first im
migration to American shores. Deep
carpets of pine needles, the accumu
lation of centuries invite rest in the
shadows of pines that started grow
ing when the ground first grew cool.
Unusual activity is promised for
the geysers this year. The snow
fall was adbnormally heavy last
winter, and the moisture which will
make the falls and cascades of un
usual beauty will add to the sensa
tional performances of boiling
springs, geysers and mud pots.
Even nature has assisted, this
year, in the vindication of Jim
Bridger's suspected tongue, and the
stage is set for a wonderful opening
of the park's fiftieth anniversary.

recently in Yellowstone national park,
another geyser, the Whistle, returned to
action at 8 a. m. Aug. 4. This was the
first recorded eruption since July 18,
1931.
The Whistle is unique because of the
great noise that accompanies the. rush'
of steam and water. Workmen heard;
the shrill whistling nearly a mile away,'
they reported. So violent was the erup- 1
tion that a crust of vari-colored algae
was blown off the formation.

        <text>HUGE GEYSER
DISCOVERED IN
YELLOWSTONE
Largest Known in History
of Park Since 1888 '
Is Found. *
lh/ Science Service
YELLOWSTONE PARK, Wyo.,
Aug. B.—A new geyser of great
magnitude, whose volume of water
discharge is greater than any other
known in Yellowstone National
Park since Excelsior geyser stopped
playing in 1888, has broken out in
the Fairy Creek section of the lower
geyser basin here.
Although the existence of this
geyser has been known for several
days, until today no data has been
given out pending the investigation:
of Ur. Arthur L. Day, director of
the geophysical laboratory of the
Carnegie Institution of Washington,
and Dr. Eugene T. Allen, who has
been filed representative of the
geophysical department of the Car
negie Institution here for the last
two years.
This huge geyser has a crater
of roughly circular form, with
diameters of 100 and 120 feet. It
erupts twice in twenty-four hours,
and each eruption last three hours
or longer. The geyser continues
to spurt at intervals of from
fifteen to twenty seconds during its
period of eruption, bursting forth
from a quiet surface with a loud
explosion and throwing a column

        <text>Yellowstone Roads Opening
Park Expecting
Heavy Travel
Yellowstone National Park’s snow
plows are busily engaged in clearing
the roads of snow, making ready for
what is expected to be the largest
travel year in the history of the park,
superintendent Edmund B. Rogers an
nounced. Last year more than a half
million people visited the nation’s
largest ami oldest playground but indi
cations are that an even larger number
will enter at the park’s five gateways
before the official travel year closes
on September 39. Excellent weather
last fall and an unusually mild winter,
with sixty miles of the park’s highway’
along tho north side from Glacier to
Uooke open throughout, the winter, has
resulted in the travel already being
considerably ahead of last year.
The snowplows are opening first the
road from Mammoth to Old Faithful
and West Yellowstone. The highways
cn the east side of the park will be
opened next and April 25 is the ten
tative date set for the opening of the
east entrance road from Cody, Wyom
ing. The south entrance ro -1 from
the Jackson Hole is expected to be
opened by May 1 and the entire grand
loop road should be traversable by
that date. The northeast entrance
from Red Lodge to Cooke should be
open by May 15.
As soon as the park roads are open
to travel, accommodations will be
available for early visitors. Meals and
lodgings will be obtainable at the
general store at Old Faithful by April
1 and when travel is permitted to
Yellow’stone Lake the store at that
location will be ready to accommodate
visitors. Tho general store and gas
oline filling station at Mammoth have
been open throughout the winter and
similar service will be available at
Old Faithful by April 1.
The . fishing season this year opens
on May 30, the same as last year,
and visitors to the park over the
Decoration Day holiday period will be
able to share in the first catches
from the various park waters. Yellow
stone Lake will be open to fishing
starting May 30 but tho Yellowstone
River from a point 150 yards above
Fishing Bridge to the Upper Falls at
Canyon will remain closed until July
1.

        <text>ontana Offers Tourists a Paradise
now Tipped Mountain
n
o o
aune
BY CHESTER C. DAVIS,
State Commissioner of Agriculture.
Delightful Montana , a land of distances and of
alpine heights, a paradise of lake and forest, snow tip
ped mountains and broad vistas of rolling valley and
plain, invites weary city folks and dwellers of the flat places
to come and learn the real meaning of the word "recreation."
It invites them to come when all the east is sweltering and
sleep there is impossible. It promises them refreshing sleep,
glorious scenery, splendid trout fishing, big game hunting in
season and the varied matchless attractions that are contain
ed within Montana's 147.187 square miles of territory.
The national parks—Glacier in the,*,
northwestern and Yellowstone in the
south central part of the state—the
oil fields of eastern Montana, the lted
!>Jdns on the Indian reservations, the
old time stock ranches in the badlands
sind the grazing districts where the
cowboy is making his last stand, the
mine« and smelters, the Custer, the
Big Ilole and other Indian battlefields,
the gigantic power plants, the numerous
hot springs, the irrigated valleys that
fleck the silent prairies of the eastern
part of the state and the primeval
forests that flauk the bold mountain
ranges of western Montana—these are
some of the attractions from which
the visitor may make his own choice.
Roads and Accommodations
Montana has good roads. Most of
the towns maintain tourist camps. Ac
commodations range from the palatial
hotels of the national parks and the
larger cities to the primitive log cab
ins set in forest wildernesses. Neither
Montana's scenery nor its other at
t rgctions have been commercialized,
(rood highways .have made accessible
good fishing streams, attractive big
pi nie districts and remarkable scenery.
Luxuriously appointed hostelries have
been built, but this is not all. The
forests aud the wild life of the moun
tains. streams and lakes are there to
day as they were in the days when the
• 'row, the Blackfeet :i uni the Flathead
Indians roamed the laud.
The visitor who wants to rough it.
!>ml have a taste of pioneer life, has
the opportunity so to do in Montana.
Hundreds of square miles are to be
found in the mountainous portions of
rhi* state that are uninhabited. Pros
pectors looking for golden treasures,
ihtrepid big game hunters, and forest
rangers are almost the only visitors.
There are no roads and, in many in
stances, not even trails, through these
remote districts. The prospectors
travel afoot, and the hunters, and for
est rangers on horseback, with pack
horses to carry their duffle.
Temperatures Never Oppressive
When the muggv, stifling heat of
other parts of the'country is scarcely
endurable, is the time to come to Mon
tuna. There are very few nights in
u year when the blankets are not de
sirablc. "The summer temperatures
are l ever oppressive," states Bulletin
*{ of the I'nited States weather bu
roan in considering the Montana cli
mate. "During the middle of the long
summer days of this high altitude the
temperature often rises higher than in
the southern suites, but it cools rap
i'llv i:i the evening bv radiation and
HOT NIGHTS ARE NEVER EXPE
RIENCED." The average daily tem
perature for May in Montana is 50.7
degrees. .lune, 00.2 degrees; July, 05.8
<]psr'*ei's; August. O.'Ï.T degrees; Sep
tember. 54.1 degrees, and October, 43.5

Wild Animal Life Abundant
There are few places in the north
ern hemisphere that have the wild ani
mal life to be found in Montana. There
are several reasons for this. The Yel
lowstone National park, in the south
ern part of the state, is the largest and
most successful wild animal refuge in
the world. It contains more than 30,
000 elk. several hundred moose, numer
ous bear, innumerable deer, many ante
lope and a large and increasing herd
of buffalo is maintained in its natural
state. In Glacier National park, in the
northern part of the state, is another
big game refuge. In western Montana
is the National Bison range, where a
herd of buffalo is maintained in its
natural state. Elk aud other big game
are also to be found on the range. In
addition to these game preserves there
are 851.000 acres, exclusive of the Sun
River Game preserve, set aside on na
tional forests where hunting is pro
hibited. The last census made by the
supervisors of game on national for
ests in Montana, considered by no
means complet , revealed a count of
13,918 elk. 43.423 deer. 3.453 mountain
goats, 1.S78 moose, 175 antelopes and
30 caribou. It is a common experience
for tourists drivin» through the moun
tains to run across elk, deer or bear j
by the roadside. Grouse and fool hens '
abound in the mountainous districts,
prairie chickens in the grain growing
districts of eastern Montana and sage
hens in the grazing areas. In the fall
hunters find Montana a wild fowl para
dise.
Glories of the Yellowstone
It was the Yellowstone National park
which gave the first big impetus to
tourist travel in the United States and
directed attention to Montana. This
was augmented when the (»lacier Na
tional park was created. While there
•? « wealth of scenery and other attrac
tion» throughout the state, it is oni j
natural that the two paiks lein.nn the
attractions.
The Yellowstone National park, con- |
taining 3,348 square miles and located j
in Montana. Wyoming and Idaho, was
created in 1872. The main entrance,
which was dedicated by President
Roosevelt, is at Gardiner, in Mon- i
tana, along the north boundary. There j
is a western entrance at Yellowstone, j
Mont., and an eastern entrance at Cody, j
Wyo. The Yellowstone is the best j
known of the national parks. Its gey- j
sers are celebrated the world over be
cause for size, power and variety of 1

Noble Mountains of Glacier
The Glacier National park, in north
western Montana, incloses 1,534 square
miles of "the noblest mountain coun
try in America," according to the Na
tional Park service. It was established
in 1910 and its name is derived from
its 00 glaciers. In ruggedness and
sheer grandeur it probably surpasses
the Alps, in the opinion of the park
service, though geologically it is mark
edly différé - ^. It resembles the Cana
dian Rockies more closely than any
other scenic country. The latter have
the advantage of more imposing masses
of snow and ice in summer, but, for
that very reason, Glacier is much more

easily and comfortably traveled.
"To define Glacier National park,"
says the National Park service, "pic
ture to yourself two approaching
chains of vast tumbled mountains,
which pass the continental divide back
and forth between them in wormlike
twistings, which bear living glaciers, in
every hollow of their loftiest convolu
initions, and which break precipitately
thuosands of feet to iower mountain
masses, which, in their turn, bear in
numerable lakes of unbelievable charm,
offspring of the glaciers above; these
lakes, iii their turn, giving birth to
roaring rivers of icy water, leaping
turbenily from level to level, carving
innumerable sculptured gorges of
grandeur and indescribable beauty." It
is on the east that the scenic quality
of these parallel mountain masses be
come titanic.
Tourists in quest of knowledge and
pleasure are urged by the National
Park service to spend a month or
more camping out in the Glacier park.
Once off the excellent trails in the
developed part of the park, wild ani
mals are more frequent and tamer,
fishing is finer, and" the federal park
officials assert many of the valleys
have not been thoroughly explored, and
some of them never have been entered
unless possibly by Indians • from the
Blackfeet reservation adjoining the
park on the east.
Visit Both Parks
Tourists visiting one of the parks
in Montana will make a mistake if they
do not visit tlie other while in the
northwest. The railroads this year are
offering combination tickets from east
ern points permitting the tourist to
come west by the wa.T of the Glacier
National park, thence to the Yellow
stone and eastward and vice versa.
The only thing the two parks have in
common is that they are national parks.
Scenery, topography, everything is
different. The parks are approximately
400 miles apart. The big motor busses
of the transportation companies make
the trip in two days with <i night stop
over at Helena. It is an easy and de
lightful three day trip for the private
automobile with much to see on the
way. Four alternative routes are
offered, each of which holds specia'
attractions for the visitor. In connec
tion with this phase of the matter,
the director of the National Park ser
vice in his 1020 report says: "All of
the states offer exceptional smaller
circle tours within the limits of their
respective boundaries, which will con
siderably distribute the interpark travel
through their different communiHes as
it passes from one park to the other.
Particularly is this true of Montana,
whose cross-state roads are being ex
tensively developed."
Highways Into Montana
There are three main east and west
transcontinental highways traversing
Montana, three main north and south
direct interpark highways, and a fourth
north and south highway that swings
northwesterly from Billings through
the best developed oil field of the
state to Glacier park and is part of
the Custer Battlefield Hiway.
The visitor from the east, if he
comes from Duluth, Superior or other
northern Minnesota or northern Wis
consin points, can follow the Roose
velt highway which enters Montana at
Highway Covers 6,000 Miles
Y-G Bee Line, Link of National Park to Park
Highway, Goes Through Great Falls.
The National Park to Park highway
is In many ways unique among the na
tionally important highways of the
United States. This is the only such
highway to which the National govern
ment.. acting through the officers of
the National Park service, has given
official recognition, and it did this be
cause the movement was intended to
link together the national parks of the
west, there making theni more access
ible and, therefore, more attractive.
The national parks arc the best ad
vertised and most - universally known
places in the western United States, if
not in the United States as a whole.
The advertising has been carried on in
magazine articles, school test books,
government publications, railroad pub
licity matter, publications of cities,
towns aijd stales, and in fact through
almost every known medium of pub
licity over a period of many years. The
length of this advertising varies from
a few years in the case of some of the
new national parks. Kuchvffi\the Gla
cier. over a period of nearly a half
a century in the case of the Yellow
stone. The result is that there is
a great desire rn the minds of many
millions of people, not only in the
United States, but also in Europe, to
sec the American national parks.
Highway 6,000 Milos in Length
Taking advantage of this situation,
a highway was worked out to make
these parks accessible and to connect
them with each other, resulting in the
stimulating of the desire to see not
only one but all of the national parks.
This highway, known as the National
Bark to Park highway, leads from one
to another in a great circle approxi
mately 0,000 miles in length. The
travelers following this great master
highway are ultimately taken into and
through so much of the west, drawn
on by the lure of the national parks,
that all portions of the west are profit
ing. not only from the rich harvest
of the tour'^'t travel, but from the fact
that a very large percent of such
travelers are attracted to different
locations and become pemanent settlers i
and residents.
Within the great circle of the Na
tional Park to Park highway itself,
other highways lead across like the
spokes of a wheel, with Salt Lake as
the hub, and the National Park to
Park highway is also intersected by
every great trans-continental highway
leading in from the east.
The National Park to Park highway
leads through 11 of the western states
and links together Glacier National
Park in Montana. Mt. ltanier National
park in Washington, Crater Lake Na
tional park in Oregon. Mt. Lassen,
Yoscmite, and Sequoia (Big Trees) Nu
Bainville, follows the Great Northern
westward through the Milk River val
ley touching Glasgow. Malta, Dodson,
Chinook and Havre, then on to Shelby
and Cut Bank, through the Blackfeet
Indian reservation to Glacier National
park. The automobile must be
shipped by rail from Glacier Park sta
tion over the continental divide to
Belton. the western entrance to
j Glacier. The Roosevelt highway
I then goes through one of the most
! beautiful parts of the state, touch
ing Kalispell, Marion. Libby and Troy
! into Idaho by way of Bonner's Ferry
and thence westward to Spokane and
the coast.
Tourists from St. Paul, Minneapolis,
Milwaukee, Chicago and points east
ward have their choice of two routes,
the National Parks highway or the
Yellowstone trail. The National
Parks highway goes from Chicago by
way of Milwaukee, through LaCrosse
to the Twin Cities, and thence through
St. Cloud and Fargo into Montana by
way of Yates. Wibaux and Glen
<live. The Yellowstone trail ctomes
westward from Chicago by way of
Milwaukee through Oshkosh and Eau
Claire to the Twin Cities and thence
through Montevideo, Milbank and
Aberdeen into Montana by way of
Baker. Ismay and Fallon. From
Fallon these two trails follow the
same highway through Montana, wind
ing westward up the fertile Yellow
stone to Livingston, where the road
branches southward to Gardiner, the
main entrance to the Yellowstone
National park. Snow-capped moun
tains rim the rich and irrigated val
ley of the Gallatin as the main road
continues west from Livingston
through Boreman. Belgrade and Man
hattan to the Wiree forks of the Mis
souri, discovered and named Three
Forks by Lewis and Clark on the
memorable expedition that opened to
the I'nited Stales the northwestern
countrv. Here the road forks, the
southern fork going by way of White
hall. Butte, Anaconda and Deer Lodge,
over the main range to Garrison, and
the northern fork going by way of
either Townsend or Boulder through
Helena to Garrison. It was a short
distance west of Garrison that gold
was first discovered in 1852 in what
is now Montana. The highway darts
westward Missoula through the
cam-on of the Hellgate river and a
short distance beyond Missoula again
forks, tha southern fork following the
St Regis river through Superior and
St Regis to Wallace, Ida., and thence
to Spokane and points west. I he
northern fork follows the Cark s fork
of the Columbia through Ravalli and
Thompson Falls to Sand Point, Ida.,
and thence to Spokane.
From Omaha and Sioux Falls
Another highway from the east of
increasing importance is the Custer
Battlefield highway which, starting at
Omaha, runs north Sioux ï alls,
thence due west across South Dakota,
northwesterlv through the picturesque
Black Hills,'and across Wyoming into
Montana *t Wyola. It traverses the
Crow Indian reservation, passes the
Custer Battlefeild where Custer and
his entire command were wiped out by
the Indians in *1870, and intersects
the Yellowstone .and National Parks
highway at Billings. From Billings it
goes northward to Roundup, the scene
of the first oil activity in Montana,
and then to Grass Range, where a
road runs east a few miles to the Cat
Creek oil field. I.ewistown. the cen
ter of the prosperous Judith Basin
country, is 'he largest town on the
route between Billings and Great
Falls. The road continues northwes
terly out of Lewistown through the
tional parks in «California, Grand Can
yon National park in Arizona. Mesa
Verde (Cliff Dwellings) and Rocky
Mountain National parks in Colorado,}
Zion National park in Utah, and Yel-j
Iowstone National park iu Wyoming
and Montana. In addition it links to
gether 20 national forests and runs
through 12 of the largest industrial
cities and travel centers of the west.
besides approximately 150 towns and
villages of lesser importance.
Headquarters al Denver
The headquarters of this highway
association are at Denver, where Gus
Ilolms. formerly of Cody. Y\ yo„ has
an office as secretary anil general man
ager. The other officers are Scott
Leavitt of Great Falls, president; Syl
vester L. Weaver, who is president
of the Los Angeles Chamber of Com
merce and president of the Weaver
Roof Manufacturing company of that
city, and Father C. Yabre. of Flagstaff.
Arizona, who is one of the leading good
roads advocates in the southwest, vice
presidents ; and F. J. Chamberlain,
Denver, Colorado, businessman, treas
urer. Chairman of the board of di
rectors is Charles Tyng, of Salt Lake
City. Utah. Mr. Tyng is a very prom
inent business man and is well known
to the Rotarians of the entire country.
L. L. Newton, of Cody. Wyo., the secre
tary of the board of directors, is a
prominent merchant and newspaperman
and is president of the Wyoming Good
Roads association. The remainder of
the board of directors is as follows:
Dr. S. F. Way, of Livingston, Mont..;
Dr. J. E. McDermond, of Poeatello,
Ida.; Robert >1. Dyer, of Seattle,

Nev. ; Judge L. V. Root, of Winslow,
Ariz.; Col. D. lv. B. Sellers. Albu
qjerque, N. M.; and G. V. llodgin, of
Canon City, Colo.
This highway, therefore, gives Great
Falls a community of interest with the
highway movement of the entire west.
It joins in a co-operative endeavor
with such cities as Spokane, Seattle,
Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles,
and Denver, in the promotion of a
movement to develop the resources of
the western states, building on the
attractiveness of the national parks as
the foundation to bring many people
into these states. In the annual report
to the secretary of the interior, cover
ing the 1021 travel season, Hon.
Stephen T. Mather, director of the Na
tional Park service, of -Washington.
D. C., said, "The designation ill 1920
of the National Park to Park highway,
which touche* in one fcteat circle the
major national parks of -the, west, has
undoubtedly stimulated motor travel." 4

state. The road follows the Bitter

.Every Mile Interesting
Every mile of the way is something
worth seeing on any of these highways.
Each of them abounds in good fishing
streams, impressive mountain ranges
and scenes and incidents inseparably
connected with the early history of
the west. Equally true is this .of the
Custer battlefield highway through
Montana, which- is the route x>ersons
especially interested m the developed
oil fields of the state should take
There are many worth while side j
trips- South of Billings, in Carbon i
county, for instance, is the Beartooth j
plateau in the Beartooth National
forest. It is accessible only to pack
horses, which may be procured at Red
Lodge. Two days' steady climbing up
the mountains brings one to the pla
teau, a waste of granite, lakes and
small glaciers that is literally "the roof
of the world." One glacier, called the
Grasshopper, derives its name from the
fact that millions of these insects are
embedded in the crystal clear ice. 4
The great rolling prairies of eastern
Montana, formerly the greatest "cow
country," are a never ending place of
fascination to the "visitor. There are
also many spots of beauty and excel
lent camping grounds in the badlands
and along the rivers.
The western part of the state has
much fascination for the tourist be
cause of its mountains and lakes.
